Contrastingly, issues relating to the design and ergonomic evaluation of multimodal output messages combining speech with visual modalities have not yet been addressed extensively. The experimental study presented here addresses one of these issues. Its aim is to assess the actual efficiency and usability of oral system messages including some brief spatial information for helping users to locate objects on crowded displays rapidly and without effort. Target presentation mode, scene spatial structure and task difficulty were chosen as independent variables. Two conditions were defined: the visual target presentation mode (VP condition) and the multimodal target presentation mode (MP condition). Each participant carried out two blocks of visual search tasks (120 tasks per block, and one block per condition). Scene target presentation mode, scene structure and task difficulty were found to be significant factors. Multimodal target presentation mode proved to be more efficient than visual target presentation. In addition, participants expressed very positive judgments on multimodal target presentations which were preferred to visual presentations by a majority of participants. Besides, the contribution of spatial messages to visual search speed and accuracy was influenced by scene spatial structure and task difficulty. First, messages improved search efficiency to a lesser extent for 2D array layouts than for some other symmetrical layouts, although the use of 2D arrays for displaying pictures is currently prevailing. Second, message usefulness increased with task difficulty. Most of these results are statistically significant.", "abstract_only_llm": "Multimodal interfaces have become increasingly popular in various applications, combining speech with visual modalities to convey information.

A total of 2880 tasks were performed by participants under two conditions: visual presentation (VP) and multimodal presentation (MP), where oral messages included coarse information on target location. The results showed that multimodal presentation significantly reduced selection times and error rates compared to visual presentation. Specifically, averaged target selection times were thrice longer in the VP condition than in the MP condition. Moreover, participants expressed positive judgments on multimodal target presentations, with 75% of them finding it easier to spot targets in the MP condition. The results also suggested that spatial information messages improved visual search performances, particularly in difficult tasks.\nThe study contributes to validating hypothesis B, which posits that messages including information on target location facilitate visual search for familiar pictures or graphical objects.

Contrastingly, to our knowledge, issues relating to the design and ergonomic evaluation of multimodal output messages combining speech with visual modalities, mainly 2D or 3D graphics, have not yet been addressed extensively. Until recently, main research efforts have been focused on the implementation of speech either as a substitute for text in the design of multimedia documents, or as a useful alternative (or supplementary) output medium for both blind (or ill-sighted) users and mobile users of PDAs, wearable computers or embedded systems. Speech and graphics appear as useful output modalities. First, speech is the most natural human communication modality. Second, most current interactive applications use graphics as their main output modality. Recent scientific advances in the area of conversational user interfaces [3] are liable to stimulate research aimed at endowing interactive systems with human-like multimodal communication capabilities. In particular, numerous prototypes of human-like embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have been developed, ranging from talking heads to real robots. The main aim of the work presented here is to assess the actual efficiency and usability of speech as a supplementary output modality to standard visual presentations. We performed an experimental study with a view to determining whether oral messages including coars\n\nuantitative and qualitative results confirm those presented in [4, 5] for more complex tasks and other combinations of modalities: speech+graphics versus text+graphics. They partly validate hypothesis A: additional oral information on the location of a visually familiar target on the display significantly improves visual search efficiency effectively. Such messages also increase visual search comfort, and will get wide user acceptance. Effects of Scene Structure In the reference condition (VP), the four spatial structures can be ordered as follows according to increasing averaged selection times: Radial (5626 ms), Random, Matrix, Elliptic (6250 ms Concerning accuracy (see table 5 ), \"actual errors\" only are considered in this subsection and the next one. They include mouse clicks on non targets and clicks on the background (i.e., targets not found); clicks near the target (22) are considered as hits. In the VP condition, rates of actual errors range from 21\\% (Random structure) to 30\\%\n\n ms versus 1747 ms). Table 2 .

These results are somewhat unexpected, since participants were experienced computer users, and the use of 2D arrays is currently prevailing for displaying pictures.

The appearance transformation between camera views is encoded by a co-occurrence matrix of visual word joint distributions in probe and gallery images.

Re-id deals with maintaining identities of individuals traversing different cameras. As in the literature we consider re-id for two cameras and focus on the problem of matching probe images of individuals in Camera 1 with gallery images from Camera 2. The problem is challenging for several reasons. Cameras views are non-overlapping so conventional tracking methods may fail. Illumination, view angles and configurations for different cameras are generally non-consistent, leading to significant appearance variations to the point that features seen in one camera are often distorted or missing in the other. Finer bio-metrics like face and gait thus often become unreliable [3] . The existing papers mainly focus on designing distinctive signature to represent a person under different cameras, or learning an effective matching methodology to predict if two images describe the same person. Our proposed method diverts from the literature by aiming to learn an appearance model that is based on co-occurrence statistics of visual patterns in different camera views. Namely, our appearance model captures the appearance \"transformation\" across cameras instead of some unknown invariant property among different views. Particularly, our method does not assume any smooth appearance transformation across different cameras. Instead, our method learns the visual word co-occurrence patten\n\nl efficiency, and assume that P H is a uniform distribution for simplicity without further learning. The main idea here is that by introducing the latent displacement variables, we have a handle on view-specific distortions observed in the two cameras. We only show the performance using the latent kernel in our experimental section, since it produces much better performance than the other two in our preliminary results. a collection of codeword slices. For each codeword slice, the max operation is performed at every pixel location to search for the spatially closest codeword in the slice. This procedure forms a distance transform image, which is further mapped to a spatial kernel image. It allows each peak at the presence of a codeword to be propagated smoothly and uniformly. To calculate the matching score for a codeword co-occurrence, the spatial kernel from a probe image and another from a gallery image are multiplied element-wise and then summed over all latent locations.

Starting with the idea that a good visual representation is one that transforms linearly under scene motions, we show, using the theory of group representations, that any such representation is equivalent to a combination of the elementary irreducible representations. We derive a striking relationship between irreducibility and the statistical dependency structure of the representation, by showing that under restricted conditions, irreducible representations are decorrelated. Under partial observability, as induced by the perspective projection of a scene onto the image plane, the motion group does not have a linear action on the space of images, so that it becomes necessary to perform inference over a latent representation that does transform linearly.

(2014) ), and invariance to groups such as translations, rotations and projective transformations is indeed very important for object recognition. However, for a general purpose visual representation -capable not only of supporting recognition tasks but also motion understanding and geometrical reasoning -invariance is not enough. Instead, the transformation properties of a representation are crucially important. If we could understand how a given representation of visual data transforms under various rigid or non-rigid transformations of the latent 3D scene, we would be in a better position to build an integrated system that computes invariant representations as well as motion and relative poses of objects. However, performing a mathematical analysis of the transformation properties of, for example, the hidden layer in a deep neural network under motions of a 3D scene is extremely complicated. A better approach is to directly impose good transformation properties on a representation space, and then learn the mapping between data and representation space such that these transformation properties are realized (Hinton et al., 2011) . In this paper we study the transformation properties of distributed representations, using tools from group representation theory (Sugiura, 1990) . We relate the transformation properties of a distributed representation to statistical notions such as decorrelati\n\nresentations: p(x t | xt-1 ) = l p l (x l t | xl t-1 ) , so in this model an irreducible representation gives us conditional independence. PARTIAL OBSERVABILITY In reality, we do not observe the complete scene x ∈ S but only a projected image I ∈ I, which we model as a function I : R 2 → R 3 (for 3 color channels). Naively, one could try to construct a representation T : SE(3) × I → I such that the perspective projection π : S → I is an equivariant map: T (g) • π = π • T (g), but this is not possible. The reason is that a 3D motion can bring entirely new structures into the image. In classical computer vision, the solution is sought in strong assumptions on the scene geometry, such as the assumption that the scene is planar, in which case one obtains a representation of the projective group on the image plane. This assumption leads to neat formulas but real scenes are not flat. A better approach to the problem of partial observability is to model all variability that is not caused by t\n\ntier. One of the central challenges is to move away from the idea that images are i.i.d. draws from an underlying distribution (as is the case only in current day benchmark datasets), and begin to model the dynamics of the visual world. Another challenge is to generalize effectively from few examples, which necessitates the exploitation of symmetries of the data distribution. Both of these problems require us to take a closer look at the transformation properties of learned visual representations. In this paper, we have theoretically studied the consequences of assuming a linear representation of a symmetry group in the observed or latent representation space. We have shown that the entire class of such models can be understood mathematically (they are all direct sums of irreducible representations), and have shown how the theory specializes for the case of the 3D rotation group. Furthermore, we have shown that under uniform sampling of orbits, the geometrical objective of learning a linear, unitary and irreducible representation leads to decorrelated representations, thereby shedding new light on this common learning objective.

Since the heart starts pumping blood early during embryonic development Hamburger and Hamilton (1951) ; Martinsen (2005) cardiogenesis mainly occurs under blood flow conditions. Blood flow is essential for proper cardiac development, with altered flow or absence of flow leading to cardiac malformations Clark and Rosenquist (1978) ; Hogers et al. (1999) ; Hove et al. (2003) ; Sedmera et al. (1999) ; Tobita et al. (2005) . Physically, the interaction of blood flow with cardiac walls generates hemodynamic forces that are exerted on cardiac tissues and that contribute to cardiac tissue deformations during the cardiac cycle. Cardiac cells sense and respond to these hemodynamic stimuli through signaling pathways that alter cell behavior, modulating genetic programs. While at least some of the biological consequences of altered blood flow can be assessed (e.g. resulting cardiac malformation, or changes in tissue composition), and the characteristics of blood flow within the heart measured (e.g. flow velocities, blood pressures), quantifying heart motion and how this motion is affected by altered blood flow conditions poses several challenges. We present here several methods for visualizing and quantifying cardiac motion during early embryonic stages. At early stages of embryonic development the heart has a tubular structure. The heart starts as a linear tu\n\nick spatial alignment Exact structural alignment between multiple chicks is, in general, not possible. This is because imaging varies from chick to chick. Although every effort has been made to consistently image the same portion of the heart, there are no features to align the images. This is compounded by imaging quality, which degrades as the OFT descends into the embryo. Even though we were careful to measure embryos at the same stage of development (HH18), the embryos do differ in size, which also influences how far into the embryo the OFT descends. Within these constraints our parameterization can be used to align the OFTs in the radial direction, and provide roughly similar spacing in the longitudinal direction, even if the starting and ending points are not the same. Specifically, we can compare the overall change along and around the tube but we cannot guarantee that these plots image the exact same portion of the tube. Clipping the ventricular end based on myocardial volume W\n\nwall motion can be clearly visualized. A contraction/expansion wave can be seen as it travels along the OFT.

( 2002 ) with area weighting. we place the cut line so that it aligns with u = 0, satisfying ( b ) above. this mapping defines the parameterization g t ( u, v ). it approximately satisfies the desired geodesic constraint ( a ), in that the mapping attempts to preserve area. ( c ) is satisfied by the construction of the planes from three equally - spaced points on the contour with constant v, provided the original surface m t does not fold back on itself longitudinally in space. informally, if the curves g t ( 0, v ), g t ( 1 / 3, v ), g t ( 2 / 3, v ) do not fold back on themselves then the sequence of triangles defined by those points will not intersect with each other. to construct our deforming mesh from the parameterization we then place a uniformly - spaced grid ( 80 nodes in the circumferential direction, 50 in the longitudinal ) on the flattened mesh and re\n\n[Chunk 2] length of the tube, since the contraction wave travels along the oft. one approach is to align the meshes based on the total volume of the tube, which essentially ignores the contraction wave. the second approach is to align meshes based on the maximum and minimum areas of a corresponding cross - section. the cross - sectional approach, however, is difficult to achieve in practice. this is because, due to the lack of features in the oft geometries, finding corresponding cross - sections in not feasible and, due to biological variations, the percentage of contraction / expansion varies from embryo to embryo. therefore, we used the volume approach and aligned embryos by volume. specifically, for each chick heart we find the point of maximal contraction by finding the outer myocardial surface with the minimum volume. we set this to be the t = 0 time point. while not perfect, this alignment is enough for our purposes. if we wish to align both the maximum contraction and the maximum expansion points in the cardiac cycle, then we split the cardiac cycle into two segments and map each temporal segment of the cardiac cycle separately for each chick, essentially enforcing that the maximum expansion occurs at t = 0. 5. we used this approach when comparing the average cross section shape in the expansion versus contraction segments of the cardiac cycle ( section 6. 3 ). between chick spatial alignment exact structural alignment between multiple chicks is, in general, not possible. this is because imaging varies from chick to chick. although every effort has been made to consistently image the same portion of the heart, there are no features to align the images. this is compounded by imaging quality, which degrades as the oft descends into the embryo. even though we were careful to measure embryos at the same stage of development ( hh18 ), the embryos do differ in size, which also influences how far into the embryo the oft descends. within these constraints our parameterization can be used to align the ofts in the radial direction, and provide roughly similar spacing in the longitudinal direction, even if the starting and ending points are not the same. specifically, we can compare the overall change along and around the tube but we cannot guarantee that these plots image the exact same portion of the tube. clipping the ventricular end based on myocardial volume we have described so far our eulerian approach, in which cardiac tissue motion moves and deforms within two fixed end planes. in our lagrangian approach, we use the incompressibility of\n\nConstraints: Use only the context.

The proposed framework uses domain-specific ontologies to map the lowlevel image's features to high-level ontology concepts, making the classification and visual contents retrieval more efficient. The proposed retrieval framework is made secure using the concept of image steganography by embedding the image's semantics inside them. To increase the security, the semantics and input image are divided into four blocks and each message block is embedded into one of the four image blocks using a secret pattern. Furthermore, the semantics are encrypted prior to data hiding, making the extraction of embedded semantics more challenging for attackers without the required authentic information. The proposed framework reduces the computational complexity of traditional retrieval systems, making it more suitable for secure and real-time visual contents retrieval in medical and lawenforcement authorities' databases.

As a result, academic researchers and industrial practitioners are facing challenges that demand more transparent and explainable systems for better understanding and analyzing machine learning models, especially their inner working mechanisms. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, there are some initial efforts on interactive model analysis. These efforts have shown that interactive visualization plays a critical role in understanding and analyzing a variety of machine learning models. Recently, DARPA I2O released Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) [4] to encourage research on this topic. The main goal of XAI is to create a suite of machine learning techniques that produce explainable models to enable users to understand, trust, and manage th\n\nllows users to interactively (1) merge topics, (2) create topics based on exemplar documents, (3) split topics, and (4) create topics based on keywords. Moreover, UTOPIAN also supports topic keyword refinement. All these interactions are centered around a semi-supervised formulation of NMF that enables an easy incorporation of user knowledge and an incremental update of the topic model. There are also some refinement tools that aim to help business professionals who are not familiar with complex machine learning models. For example, Wang et al. developed a visual analytics system, TopicPanorama [14, 34] , to help business professionals analyze and refine a full picture of relevant topics discussed in multiple textual sources. The full picture is generated by matching the topic graphs extracted from different sources with a scalable algorithm to learn correlated topic models [36] . TopicPanorama allows users to identify potentially incorrect matches by examining the uncertainties of the\n\nclassifiers, and parameters used in training. For example, the technique developed by Paiva et al. [15] allows users to interactively select training samples, modify their labels, incrementally update the model, and rebuild the model by using new classes. Fig. 8 shows how this technique supports informed training sample selection. Figure 9 : 9 Figure 9: UTOPIAN [33], a visual analytics system for interactive refinement of topic models.

[ 39 ] developed a probabilistic program induction algorithm. they built simple stochastic programs to represent concepts, building them compositionally from parts, subparts, and spatial relations. they also demonstrated that their algorithm achieved human - level performance on a one - shot classification task, while outperforming recent deep learning approaches. however, for the tasks that have abundant training data, such as object and speech recognition, the less explainable deep learning still outperforms the algorithm. thus, there is still a long way to go for researchers to develop more explainable models for these tasks. analysis of online training process most of the existing methods focus on analyzing the final results [ 28 ] or one snapshot [ 2 ] of the model in the interactive training process. in many cases, only analyzing the results or a single snapshot is not enough to understand why a training process did not achieve a desirable performance. thus, it is necessary to analyze the online training process. one challenge in analyzing the online training process is the difficulty of selecting and comparing representative snapshots from a large number of snapshots. when comparing different snapshots, one possible solution is to adopt progressive visual analytics [ 40 ] to shorten the period of time between user interactions and the execution of the model. the basic idea of progressive visual analytics is to produce meaningful partial results during the training process and integrating these partial results into an interactive visualization, which allows users to immediately explore the partial results. another challenge\n\n[Chunk 2] experts quickly identify the potential issues in a machine learning model of interest. second, it is challenging to model different types of uncertainties as well as their interactions by using a unified framework. during the interactive model analysis process, there are uncertainties that originate from the machine side ( e. g., imperfect machine learning models ) and uncertainties that originate from the human side ( e. g., incorrect expert feedback ). these two kinds of uncertainties will interact with and influence each other. for example, if the system presents misleading information to the experts, they may return incorrect feedback that results in problematic modification of the model. another example is figure 1 : 1 figure 1 : a pipeline of machine learning. figure 2 : 2 figure 2 : an overview of interactive model analysis. figure 3 : 3 figure 3 : comparison of test sample representations ( a ) before and ( b ) after training [ 20 ]. fig. 3 3 fig. 3 shows a point - based visualization developed by rauber et al. [ 20 ]. in this figure, each point denotes the learned representation of a test sample. the color of each point encodes the class label of each test sample. as shown in the figure, after training, the visual separation between classes is significantly improved. this observation provides evidence for the hypothesis that neural networks learn to detect representations that are useful for class discrimination. fig. 3 ( 3 fig. 3 ( b ) also helps with the understanding of misclassified samples, which are marked by triangle glyphs. the figure illustrates that many misclassified samples are visual outliers whose neighbors have different classes. also, many outliers correspond to test samples that are difficult for even humans to classify. figure 4 : 4 figure 4 : topology of a neural network trained to classify brain and non - brain materials [ 17 ]. ffigure 5 : 5 figure 5 : cnnvis, a visual analytics approach to understanding and diagnosing deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) [ 2 ] with a large number of neurons and connections. figure 6 : 6 figure 6 : a visual analytics tool that helps machine learning experts diagnose model performance with ( a ) a confusion wheel and ( b ) a feature analysis view [ 27 ]. figure 7 : 7 figure 7 : squares, a visual analytics tool that supports performance diagnosis of multi - class figure 8 : 8 figure 8 : interactive training sample selection that enables classifier refinement [ 15 ]. candidate samples are represented by ( a ) circles and ( b\n\nConstraints: Use only the context.

Being able to explore the decisions a model makes and identifying potential issues is crucial in application areas where experts need to get a sense of how the model works and build trust in its decisions. While common practice in much of the machine learning endeavors is to focus on model accuracy, many researchers have voiced the need for more transparency when the application domain requires it [4, 8, 12, 22, 23, 31] . A recent DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) program called \"Explainable AI (XAI)\", for example, calls for more research in this area and declares, as the main motivation for the program that \"the effectiveness of these systems is limited by the machines current inability to explain their decisions and actions to human users\" and that \"it is essential to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage an emerging generation of artificially intelligent machine partners\".

Likewise, a value smaller than one indicates that it is significantly negative. However, if the confidence interval crosses one the subset is not significantly different.

Our approach enables attention to be calculated at the level of objects and other salient image regions (right). In the human visual system, attention can be focused volitionally by top-down signals determined by the current task (e.g., looking for something), and automatically by bottom-up signals associated with unexpected, novel or salient stimuli [3, 6] . In this paper we adopt similar terminology and refer to attention mechanisms driven by nonvisual or task-specific context as 'top-down', and purely visual feed-forward attention mechanisms as 'bottom-up'.

In both these tasks it is often necessary to perform some fine-grained visual processing, or even multiple steps of reasoning to generate high quality outputs.\nConstraints: Do not invent datasets, baselines, or numerical results.\nIf results are not stated, describe them generally.\n\nWrite a concise abstract (150-250 words).", "only_llm_output": "The integration of computer vision and natural language processing has led to significant advancements in tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, these applications often require fine-grained visual processing and multiple steps of reasoning to generate high-quality outputs. The visual understanding of images, in particular, remains a challenging problem, as it necessitates the extraction of relevant features, the identification of objects and their relationships, and the integration of this information with linguistic context.\nTo address these challenges, this research focuses on developing multimodal fusion and reasoning techniques that can effectively combine visual and linguistic information. By leveraging the strengths of both modalities, our approach aims to enhance visual understanding and improve the accuracy of image-based applications. We investigate the role of attention mechanisms, graph-based reasoning, and neural architecture design in facilitating the fusion of visual and linguistic features. The proposed techniques are evaluated in a range of image-based tasks, demonstrating their potential to improve the performance and robustness of visual understanding systems. By advancing the state-of-the-art in visual understanding, this research contributes to the development of more effective and efficient multimodal fusion and reasoning techniques.", "rag_queries": ["What is the main problem or motivation addressed in this paper?", "What method or approach is proposed?

down captioning model. as indicated by this example, our approach is equally capable of focusing on fine details or large image regions. this capability arises because the attention candidates in our model consist of many overlapping regions with varying scales and aspect ratios - each aligned to an object, several related objects, or an otherwise salient image patch. unlike conventional approaches, when a candidate attention region corresponds to an object, or several related objects, all the visual concepts associated with those objects appear to be spatially co - located - and are processed together. in other words, our approach is able to consider all of the information pertaining to an object at once. this is also a natural way for attention to be implemented. in the human visual system, the problem of integrating the separate features of objects in the correct combinations is known as the feature binding problem, and experiments suggest that attention plays a central role in the solution [ 41, 40 ]. we include an example of vqa attention in figure 6. conclusion we present a novel combined bottom - up and top - down visual attention mechanism. our approach enables attention to be calculated more naturally at the level of objects and other salient regions. applying this approach to image captioning and visual question answering, we achieve state -

up attention features. supplementary materials implementation details bottom - up attention model our bottom - up attention faster r - cnn implementation uses an iou threshold of 0. 7 for region proposal suppression, and 0. 3 for object class suppression. to select salient image regions, a class detection confidence threshold of 0. 2 is used, allowing the number of regions per image k to vary with the complexity of the image, up to a maximum of 100. however, in initial experiments we find that simply selecting the top 36 features in each image works almost as well in both downstream tasks. since visual genome [ 21 ] contains a relatively large number", "query": "What is the main problem or motivation addressed in this paper?"}, {"vector_id": 1423, "score": 0.5426595211029053, "text": "79. 4 36. 9 68. 5 27. 6 36. 7 57. 1 72. 4 117. 9 120. 5 21. 5 71. 5 figure 5. 5 figure 5. example of a generated caption showing attended image regions. for each generated word, we visualize the attention weights on individual pixels, outlining the region with the maximum attention weight in red. avoiding the conventional trade -

space display [ 17 ] without treating multiple variables as a whole. nevertheless, shared - space techniques may not be efficient to visualize high - dimensional mts dataset since the resulting shared - space visualization may show a large amount of overlapping and clutter between different variables'time series, which is difficult to interpret. for instance, as shown in figure 3, in [ 10 ], the authors proposed a technique named multivariate time series amalgam ( mtsa ), to jointly visualize multiple variables of mts on a single display. nevertheless, mtsa may not be suitable when the mts dataset has a large number of measurements or has high dimensionality. the authors in [ 16 ] proposed a visualization method for multivariate data based on star chart [ 8 ] which represents each variable on an axis, with the axes arranged around a circle. an example of this technique is depicted in figure 1. another popular technique for visualizing mts is parallel coordinates [ 9 ] ( shown in figure 2 ). these methods have limitations in interpretability when the mts has a large number of variables or a large number of time instances per variable. unlike these studies, our proposed m -

To this end, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) [22] is applied to all the pairs of a cluster, discarding it as inconsistent if the median value of SSIM for that cluster is lower than a threshold based on the global median of SSIM within the whole class (90% in this work).

tuning the network itself. positive examples to train each svm are the images belonging to that summary, and negative examples are images from other classes or from other summaries within the same class. the features used for classification are extracted from the first fully connected layer of the network. given an image to classify, it is evaluated by all of the previously trained svms. the class scores vector is then obtained by selecting the highest score among the svms for each class. the obtained scores are used to improve the classification accuracy for a desired class by means of a convex weighted sum between the neural network classification softmax vectors and the resulting svm class scores ( normalized to sum to unity ). our experiments show that employing this approach, primarily designed to improve the classification of all the 18 classes chosen for the experiments on the alexnet architecture, the overall classification accuracy score over all the 1000 imagenet classes increases by 1. 08 % on the imagenet validation set. some examples of images that are classified correctly thanks to this boosting technique can be seen in fig. 6. conclusion our approach is the first visualization system which considers multiple images at the same time, generalizing about the visual semantic entities captured by a deep network. contrarily to the standard visualization tools, advantages of our proposed approach can be measured quantitatively, the most important of them is that of improving the original network by training additional classifiers specialized on recognizing the visual summaries. the"}], "What are the main results or findings?

processing is carried out to prune out unreliable clusters. to this end, structural similarity index ( ssim ) [ 22 ] is applied to all the pairs of a cluster, discarding it as inconsistent if the median value of ssim for that cluster is lower than a threshold based on the global median of ssim within the whole class ( 90 % in this work ). this has the purpose of removing obvious mistakes in the clusters, caused by the variety of different poses that the proposal flow has not been able to deal with 1. all the parts of a valid cluster are highlighted in red and shown surrounded by the regions they belong to ; this eases the human interpretation and provides a summary ( see an excerpt in fig. 1 ). an explanation is provided for each image class using a different number of summaries, depending on the number of valid clusters that have been kept. experiments for our experiments, we focus on 18 classes of imagenet. these classes are selected considering the constraint of being adjacent in a dense [ 1 ] semantic space. in table 1, adjacent classes are in subsequent rows with same background color. this constraint, brings together those classes that are adjacent to each other which provides the possibility of comparing similar classes along different experiments. the set of experiments to validate our proposal is organized as follows : sec. 4. 1 is dedicated to show the superiority of our proposed crisp mask\n\nConstraints: Use only the context.

Due to its growing popularity, last year (2017) a version 2 of the VQA Challenge was initiated. Due to VQA's relative complexity and need for fine grained visual and textual processing, many intricate and highly tuned architectures led performance. We chose to build upon the relatively simple model proposed by last year's winners [TAHvdH17] to investigate the role of attention and ways to improve performance. At a high level, VQA models require two forms of information: text and images. The inputs to a VQA model are images and free-form, open-ended natural language questions about the image, and the model's goal is to produce a natural language answer about the input [AAL + 15]. We use pre-trained GloVe vectors and a GRU over tokenized questions to produce question embeddings, and a Faster R-CNN to generate objects centric features from the images. This information is then passed through an attention module to create a joint embedding of the image-question and the joint embedding is then passed through a classifier to produce the final answer. Our project aims to investigate previous methods of implementing VQA and to better understand the characteristics of more successful network architectures for this task. We build upon previous \n\n a sigmoid layer for each of the possible answers in our answer vocabulary. The word corresponding to the maximum of these output probabilities is then taken to be the predicted answer, from which the accuracy can then be calculated using the equation from [TAHvdH17] : accuracy = 1 m v V al (one hot(argmax(ŷ)) • y).

[13, 14, 11] use machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Regression and recurrent neural networks, applied to visual and textual cues to predict the popularity of social media videos. [2] combines cues from different modalities for the same purpose. Although popularity prediction is an important problem, we believe that it does not address all the challenges faced by online video creators. More precisely, it does not allow to answer the question of many creators: how a given frame or title word contributes to the popularity of the video? Even though correlation does not mean causality, this kind of analysis allows to understand the importance of a given piece of content and prioritize the creation efforts accordingly. Figure 1 . Sample social media video frames and its headline with visualized importance of their parts on predicted video popularity.

The final video embedding is a weighted average of these embeddings v = N i=1 α i q i . Weights α i are computed with attention mechanism implemented as a two-layer neural network [16] : the first layer produces a hidden representation u i = tanh(W u q i + b u ) and the second layer outputs unnormalized importance a i = W a u i + b a . W a can be interpreted as a trainable high level representation of the most informative vector in u i space. Final weights are normalized with softmax: α i = exp(a i )/ k exp(a k ). Headline. We represent a headline as a sequence of pre-trained GloVe [7] word vectors (w t ) N t=1 . We handle sequences of variable length using a bidirectional LSTM. Similarly to video frames, we use a two-layer attention mechanism on hidden state vectors h t to let the network learn the importance coefficients β t for each word. The final text representation d is a weighted average of hidden state vector\n\nnes). We use Keras for implementation. Results. For all methods, we follow the evaluation protocol of [13, 11] and compute the classification accuracy and Spearman correlation between the predicted probability of popular label and normalized view count of a video. Tab. 1 shows the results. Interestingly, almost equal popularity prediction results can be obtained using either video frames or headline features. Combining both modalities leads to noticeable improvement, while adding attention mechanism improves the performance in the multimodal and visual case. For headlines, the performance with attention deteriorates slightly. We speculate that the bi-directional LSTM already learns internal dependencies between hidden states and adding attention cannot help further, while for video frames it enables the network to exploit the temporal dependencies between the frames.

Generally, a dialog system consists of a pipeline of data processing modules, including automatic speech recognition, spoken language understanding, dialog management, sentence generation, and speech synthesis. However, all of these modules require significant hand engineering and domain knowledge for training. Recently, end-to-end dialog systems have been gathering attention, and they obviate this need for expensive hand engineering to some extent. In endto-end approaches, dialog models are trained using only paired input and output sentences, without relying on pre-designed data processing modules or intermediate internal data representations such as concept tags and slot-value pairs. End-to-end systems can be trained to directly map from a user's utterance to a system response sentence and/or action. This significantly reduces the data preparation and system development cost. Several types of sequence-to-sequence models have been applied to end-to-end dialog systems, and it has been shown that they can be trained in a completely data-driven manner. End-to-end approaches have also been shown to better handle flexible conversations between the user and the system by training the model on large conversational datasets [4, 5] .

In order to create better embeddings, we leverage an attention mechanism to associate image proposals with symbols and thus effectively aggregate information from aligned multimodal representations.

Our framework aims to develop a more comprehensive understanding of visual advertisements by analyzing their visual, textual, and contextual components.

While current vision approaches can successfully address object [13, 12, 14] and scene [25, 7, 3] centric interpretations of an image, deeper subjective interpretations such as rhetoric, symbolism, etc. remain challenging and have drawn limited attention from the vision community. Recently, visual ad-understanding has been addressed by Hussain et al. [9] and a dataset has been introduced to evaluate ad-understanding approaches. The authors introduce several sub-problems such as identifying the underlying topics in the ad, predicting the sentiments and symbolism referenced in the ads, associating an action and corresponding reason in response to an ad. In this work, we target understanding of ad images by formulating the task as mutimodal matching of the image and its corresponding human generated statements [24] . These statements were obtained from annotators by asking them to answer questions such as \"I should do this because\". [9] . Note that for interpreting the rhetoric conveyed by an ad image, we need to exploit the semantic, symbolic, and sentimental references made in the image. Moreover, these alternate references are correlated and influence each other to convey a specific message. For example, an ad corresponding to symbols 'humor' and 'fun' are likely to invoke 'amused' sentiment rather than 'sad'. Thus, we consider the interactions be\n\nk (1) We compute the raw attention scores for the object proposals b i by using the attended symbol vector ŝ0 as shown below. We use softmax to normalize the attention scores, denoted as α I i , and finally compute the summary vector b1 for images α I i = softmax(tanh( ŝ0 T W T φ(b i )) (2) b1 = i α I i φ(b i ) (3) where W ∈ D 2 × D 1 is used to project visual features to the symbol space. We use a number subscript in ŝ and b to denote the iteration index for the multihop version. We use a similar operation to compute attention β Z k for symbol z k using the previously attended image vector b1 as shown below: β Z k = softmax(tanh(z T k W T b1 )) (4) We use the given symbol probabilities to weigh the attention maps so as to focus on symbols present in the image as shown below: ŝ1 = k β Z k p k z k (5) We consider co-attention with only two hops to avoid overfitting. We obtain the final features for visual and symbol modalities by fusing the attended vectors at different iterations using\n\nnger' and 'safety' over the course of multihop iterations. Weakly supervised algorithms often suffer from the problem of identifying the most discriminative region(s) in an image. Hence, they may fail to cover all possible salient regions and result in overfitting. To prevent this problem, we apply a heuristic technique wherein for a given n th iteration, we suppress the image attention scores (prior to softmax operation) of the regions which received scores greater than or equal to 0.7 times the highest score in n -1 th iteration. We manually set the scores to a low value (-2). Although this simple step improved the results, we need to further investigate the use of additional constraints ( e.g. spatial and semantic) to discover other salient regions. Figure 1 : 1 Figure 1: Figure shows the image and symbol attention on a PSA ad about the importance of following safety laws. Our algorithm learns to iteratively infer the reference of the symbol 'death' with the relevant image content.

While current computer vision techniques excel in object and scene-centric interpretations of images, they often struggle to capture deeper, subjective meanings such as rhetoric, symbolism, and emotional resonance. This limitation stems from the fact that visual advertisements are designed to convey complex messages, leveraging visual elements to persuade and engage audiences.\nTo address this gap, we propose a multidisciplinary approach that integrates insights from visual perception, linguistics, and advertising theory. Our framework aims to develop a more comprehensive understanding of visual advertisements by analyzing their visual, textual, and contextual components. By examining the interplay between these elements, we seek to uncover the underlying mechanisms that enable visual advertisements to evoke emotions, create associations, and shape consumer behavior.\nOur research has the potential to contribute significantly to the field of visual content analysis, enabling the development of more sophisticated and effective visual advertising systems.", "rag_queries": ["What is the main problem or motivation addressed in this paper?", "What method or approach is proposed?

In the recent years, there has been significant progress [1, 2, 3, 4] in the performance of automated lip reading due to the application of deep neural network models and the availability of large scale datasets. However, most of these datasets are subject to some restrictions (e.g. LRW [5] or the LRS2-BBC [6] cannot be used by industrial research labs) and this has meant that it is difficult to compare the performance of one lip-reading system to another, as there is no large scale common benchmark dataset. Our aim in releasing the LRS3-TED dataset is to provide such a benchmark dataset, and one that is larger in size compared to any available dataset in this field. The LRS3-TED dataset can be downloaded from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/ ˜vgg/data/lip_reading. LRS3-TED dataset The dataset consists of over 400 hours of video, extracted from 5594 TED and TEDx talks in English, downloaded from YouTube. The cropped face tracks are provided as .mp4 files with a resolution of 224×224 and a frame rate of 25 fps, encoded using the h264 codec. The audio tracks are provided as single-channel 16-bit 16kHz format, while the corresponding text transcripts, as well as the alignment boundaries of every word are included in plain text files. The dataset is organized into three sets: pre-train, train-val and test. The first two overlap in terms of content but the las\n\nle Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) [10] to detect face appearances in the individual frames. The time boundaries of a shot are determined by comparing color histograms across consecutive frames [11] , and within each shot, face tracks are generated from face detections based on their positions. Audio and text preparation. Only the videos providing english subtitles created by humans were used. The subtitles in the YouTube videos are broadcast in sync with the audio only at sentence-level, therefore the Penn Phonetics Lab Forced Aligner (P2FA) [12] is used to obtain a word-level alignment between the subtitle and the audio signal. The alignment is double-checked against an off-the-shelf Kaldi-based ASR model. AV sync and speaker detection. In YouTube or broadcast videos, the audio and the video streams can be out of sync by up to around one second, which can introduce temporal offsets between the videos and the text labels (aligned to the audio). We use a two-stream network (SyncNet) descr\n\n duration of the face track, along with the corresponding subtitles. It is extracted from the same set of original YouTube videos as the train-val set. However, these videos may be shorter or longer than the full sentences included in the trainval and test sets, and are annotated with the alignment boundaries of every word.

However, in many critical tasks robots have to be able to cope with difficult conditions that challenge their autonomy. Of particular interest are cases involving GPS-denied Degraded Visual Environments (DVEs) that stress the abilities of onboard perception especially for Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). Examples of relevant applications include navigating, mapping and characterization of underground settings, as well as search and rescue missions. The focus of this work is on enabling reliable robotic autonomy in poorly illuminated, textureless and GPS-denied environments through the use of lightweight and ubiquitous sensing technology; specifically, miniaturized RGB-D sensors and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU). For this purpose we first develop a methodology for fusion of visual and depth information at the feature detection and descriptor extraction levels followed by the integration of these multimodal features with inertial sensor information in an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) fashion. This approach reflects the fact that small RGB-D sensors have limited range, and is different from a) methods that fuse LiDAR and visual camera data in a loosely-coupled manner, b) RGB-D SLAM algorithms that depend on vision as prime sensing modality, or c) \n\nn feature detection.

Descriptor Extraction Given a set of multimodal keypoints we extract a descriptor that utilizes both visual and depth information. For this purpose we chose to use the binary descriptor BRAND [21] because of its ability to encode visual and depth information, while maintaining fast performance during the descriptor extraction and matching processes. BRAND generates two binary strings that encode the visual and depth neighborhood information of keypoints individually, by performing pairwise intensity and geometric tests on visual and depth images respectively.

The focus is on an approach that exploits lightweight and ubiquitous RGB-D sensors and therefore can be integrated onboard small systems such as Micro Aerial Vehicles.

It requires both scene understanding in computer vision and semantic understanding in natural language processing. However, previous VQA datasets [10, 3, 4] are often severely biased and lack semantic compositionality, which makes it hard to diagnose model performance. To handle this, GQA dataset [5] is proposed.

In this work, we feed these two features for the two separate pipelines and finally combine the output. As shown in Tab 2, using both detection and spatial features improves the performance for 1%. Table 2 : Study adding spatial features. Adding bounding box features One of the drawbacks of the attention method is that it ignores the position information of the objects. Here, We normalize the coordinates of the center point of the bounding box as positional information. Similarly, we normalize the length and width of the bounding box as size information. As shown in \n\n of the question. The adding of program representation yields about 1% accuracy improvement on the GQA test split.

To achieve this, we propose an effective adversarial approach, denoted as adversarial \"hallucinator\" (AH), for robust visual tracking. The proposed AH is designed to firstly learn transferable non-linear deformations between a pair of same-identity instances, and then apply these deformations to an unseen tracked instance in order to generate diverse positive training samples. By incorporating AH into an online tracking-bydetection framework, we propose the hallucinated adversarial tracker (HAT), which jointly optimizes AH with an online classifier (e.g., MDNet) in an end-to-end manner.

Despite the outstanding success achieved by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a variety of computer vision tasks [He et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018c] , their impact in visual tracking is still limited. The main reason is that deep CNNs greatly rely on the large-scale annotated training data. For online tracking, it is impossible to gather enough training data since the tracker is required to track arbitrary objects. Thus the problem of learning an effective CNN model for visual tracking is particularly challenging, mainly due to limited online training data. To alleviate this problem, one strategy is to treat visual tracking as a more general similarity learning problem, thus enabling deep CNNs (e.g., Siamese networks) to be trained with large-scale annotated datasets in an offline manner. However, these Siamese network based trackers [Bertinetto et al., 2016b] still cannot achieve high accuracies on the benchmarks, since they inherently lack the online adaptability. Another strategy is to effectively leverage few online training samples and adopt the online learning based tracking-bydetection schema. This schema based trackers maintain an online CNN classifier, which models the temporal variations of the target appearance by updating the network parameters. Compared with the Siamese network bas\n\nescriptors in advance. Note that there are about 6, 500 snippets in the source domain, and the whole retrieval step can be implemented within 3 seconds. Fig. 3 shows that the proposed SDT method can effectively select the snippets that have similar semantic characteristics with the target exemplar into D S for better hallucination. Proposed Tracking Algorithm After training the proposed AH in an end-to-end offline manner and obtaining the selective dataset D S , we illustrate how we perform hallucinated tracking in an online tracking-bydetection framework. The details of three main components of HAT are given as follows: Joint model initialization. Given the initial target exemplar x e in the first frame, we randomly draw 32 positive samples and 96 negative samples around it as in [Nam and Han, 2016] in each iteration. Since these samples are highly spatially overlapped, they cannot capture rich appearance variations.

scale annotated training data. for online tracking, it is impossible to gather enough training data since the tracker is required to track arbitrary objects. thus the problem of learning an effective cnn model for visual tracking is particularly challenging, mainly due to limited online training data. to alleviate this problem, one strategy is to treat visual tracking as a more general similarity learning problem, thus enabling deep cnns ( e. g., siamese networks ) to be trained with large - scale annotated datasets in an offline manner. however, these siamese network based trackers [ bertinetto et al., 2016b ] still cannot achieve high accuracies on the benchmarks, since they inherently lack the online adaptability. another strategy is to effectively leverage few online training samples and adopt the online learning based tracking - bydetection schema. this schema based trackers maintain an online cnn classifier, which models the temporal variations of the target appearance by updating the network parameters. compared with the siamese network based trackers, they gain a large accuracy improvement. however, they may easily suffer from the over - fitting problem due to the limited online training samples ( especially for the positive training samples ), thus leading to suboptimal tracking performance. compared with state - of - the - art cnn - based trackers, visual tracking is a relatively simple task for humans. although how human brain works is far from being fully understood, one can conjecture that humans have a remarkable imaginary mechanism derived from their previous learning experience. that is, as illustrated in fig. 1, humans can firstly learn many shared modes of variation ( e. g., rotation, illumination change and translation ) from different pairs of same - identity instances. then they are able to hallucinate what novel instances look like in different surroundings or poses, by ap - plying their previous learned modes of variation to novel instances. for example, we can learn the motion of rotation from a windmill. based on it, we can easily imagine how a completely different windmill or even an", "query": "What is the main problem or motivation addressed in this paper?"}, {"vector_id": 127, "score": 0.48555701971054077, "text": ") plots for evaluation. we report both the dp rates at the threshold of 20 pixels ( dpr ) and the area under the curve ( auc ). for vot2016, the expected average overlap ( eao ), accuracy, failures and robustness are adopted to evaluate each tracker. ablation study first, we analyze the factors that may affect the performance of hat in table 1, including the sdt method and the ratio r of positive and negative training samples. then, we analyze the impact of the online update of ah as shown in table 2. finally, we analyze the influence of the proposed dr loss and visualize the learned hallucinations in fig. 5. note that our baseline tracker is mdnet, which does not perform the multidomain learning for fair comparison. since mdnet uses 32 positive samples and 96 negative samples in each iteration for training, we simply call it as base -

fitting problem. to alleviate this problem, we randomly select various pairs of instances in the selective dataset d s, and use the proposed ah to learn reasonable deformations in the pairs, and then apply those deformations to the target exemplar x e in order to generate diverse deformable target samples, which are labeled as positive. as illustrated in fig. 4, we use both the augmented positive samples and negative samples to jointly update ah and the fully -

scale annotated training data. for online tracking, it is impossible to gather enough training data since the tracker is required to track arbitrary objects. thus the problem of learning an effective cnn model for visual tracking is particularly challenging, mainly due to limited online training data. to alleviate this problem, one strategy is to treat visual tracking as a more general similarity learning problem, thus enabling deep cnns ( e. g., siamese networks ) to be trained with large - scale annotated datasets in an offline manner. however, these siamese network based trackers [ bertinetto et al., 2016b ] still cannot achieve high accuracies on the benchmarks, since they inherently lack the online adaptability. another strategy is to effectively leverage few online training samples and adopt the online learning based tracking - bydetection schema. this schema based trackers maintain an online cnn classifier, which models the temporal variations of the target appearance by updating the network parameters. compared with the siamese network based trackers, they gain a large accuracy improvement. however, they may easily suffer from the over - fitting problem due to the limited online training samples ( especially for the positive training samples ), thus leading to suboptimal tracking performance. compared with state - of - the - art cnn - based trackers, visual tracking is a relatively simple task for humans. although how human brain works is far from being fully understood, one can conjecture that humans have a remarkable imaginary mechanism derived from their previous learning experience. that is, as illustrated in fig. 1, humans can firstly learn many shared modes of variation ( e. g., rotation, illumination change and translation ) from different pairs of same - identity instances. then they are able to hallucinate what novel instances look like in different surroundings or poses, by ap - plying their previous learned modes of variation to novel instances. for example, we can learn the motion of rotation from a windmill. based on it, we can easily imagine how a completely different windmill or even an\n\n[Chunk 2] ) plots for evaluation. we report both the dp rates at the threshold of 20 pixels ( dpr ) and the area under the curve ( auc ). for vot2016, the expected average overlap ( eao ), accuracy, failures and robustness are adopted to evaluate each tracker. ablation study first, we analyze the factors that may affect the performance of hat in table 1, including the sdt method and the ratio r of positive and negative training samples. then, we analyze the impact of the online update of ah as shown in table 2. finally, we analyze the influence of the proposed dr loss and visualize the learned hallucinations in fig. 5. note that our baseline tracker is mdnet, which does not perform the multidomain learning for fair comparison. since mdnet uses 32 positive samples and 96 negative samples in each iteration for training, we simply call it as base - mdnet ( r = 1 / 3 ). sdt method. in table 1, by employing the proposed sdt method, hat gains the improvements on all the three datasets in terms of both dpr and auc. specifically, sdt - hat ( r = 1 / 1 ) achieves the best dpr ( 95. 1 % ) by improving 1. 9 % of hat ( r = 1 / 1 ) on otb - 2013, which can be explained that the instances selected by our sdt method share more semantic characteristics with the exemplar, thus providing more reasonable transformations for hallucination. ratios of positive and negative training samples. since the original ratio of positive and negative samples used in mdnet is 1 / 3 ( or 32 / 96 ), there still exists the data imbalance problem. we use our ah to hallucinate diverse positive samples such that the ratios of augmented positive samples and negative samples are respectively 2 / 3 ( or 64 / 96 ) and 1 / 1 ( or 96 / 96 ). in table 1, we can find that the tracking performance is significantly improved by adding more hallucinated positive samples for learning. the promising results ( dpr : 95. 1 %, auc : 69. 6 % ) can be achieved by hat on otb - 2013 when the ratio is set to 1 / 1, which demonstrates that the balanced data can lead to better results. impact of online update. as shown in table 2, we can find that hat - w - up significantly outperforms hat -

The details of convolutional architecture used in the VQA v2 model and CLEVR model are illustrated in Table 3 and Table 4 respectively in Appendix D. Bottleneck convolutional block Figure 1 (a-d ) shows the transformation of modularized ResNeXt-101 (32 × 4d) residual block to its grouped convolution form. This technique is similarly applicable for the convolutional block used for CLEVR dataset. We introduce a gating mechanism to assign weights to each of the paths (which equal 32 in the example shown). We treat each path as a convolutional module which should potentially be used for a specific function. The gate values are normalized to sum to unity and are conditioned on the LSTM based feature representation of the question. The working of gate controller is detailed in section 2.1. See Figure 2 (Appendix E) for the original ResNeXt-101 (32 × 4d) residual block. In order to optimize the computation of a ResNeXt residual block, we execute just the top-k (out of 32) paths and zero out the contribution of others. This is based on the hypothesis that the gate controller shall determine the most important modules (aka paths) to execute by assigning hi\n\nused to assign weights to the outputs of the corresponding expert networks. The gating network is an MLP followed by softmax operator. The final output of the ensemble is a weighted sum of outputs of each of the individual expert networks. [14] uses a mixture of experts for visual reasoning tasks in which each expert is a stack of residual blocks. Conditional Computation Conditional Computation is the technique of activating only a sub-portion of the neural network depending on the inputs. For instance, if a visual question answering system has to count the number of a specified object vs if it has to tell the color of an object, the specific features needed to give the correct answer in either case are different. Hence, there is a potential to reduce the amount of computation the network has to perform in each case, which can be especially useful to train large deep networks efficiently.

Their results are cornerstones to build efficient visualization systems. However, designing such an evaluation is always complex and time-consuming and may end in a lack of statistical evidence and reproducibility. We believe that modern and efficient computer vision techniques, such as deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), may help visualization researchers to build and/or adjust their evaluation hypothesis. The basis of our idea is to train machine learning models on several visualization techniques to solve a specific task. Our assumption is that it is possible to compare the efficiency of visualization techniques based on the performance of their corresponding model. As current machine learning models are not able to strictly reflect human capabilities, including their imperfections, such results should be interpreted with caution. However, we think that using machine learning-based pre-evaluation, as a pre-process of standard user evaluations, should help researchers to perform a more exhaustive study of their design space. Thus, it should improve their final user evaluation by providing it better test cases.

When designing a new visualization technique, it is necessary to assess its efficiency compared to existing ones. While computational performances can be easily evaluated, it is more complicated to assess user performances. This is usually achieved by carrying out a user evaluation that compares several techniques on one or several tasks (e.g. [12, 13, 26, 27] ). During such a study, a population of users is requested to solve several times the same task(s) using various input data presented with different visualization techniques or different variations of a technique. Experimental results (e.g., accuracy or completion time) are then statistically validated to confirm or refute some preliminary hypothesis. Completing a user evaluation can become time-consuming as the number of techniques, the considered dataset, and the number of tasks increase. As that may bias the experimental results due to loss of attention or tiredness, it is necessary to maintain the completion time of the entire evaluation reasonable. To that end, one usually tries to keep the number of experimental trials reasonable [28] by reducing the number of evaluated techniques, the number of tasks and/or the dataset. This is one of the strongest bottlenecks of user evaluations as visualization designers have to reduce the explored design space to a \n\n] .

or a lack of normalization. other explanations could be hypothetized, for instance, vgg16 might have been unable to learn due to a lack of training samples, a too short training period, or even a too large batch size. finally, it is noteworthy to mention that the model which best learned to solve task 3 converged in about 80 epochs and 100 epochs were not enough with others, whereas the mean of convergence speed for the 3 counting tasks is 31 epochs. thus, it could be interesting to study whether this result means that there is a correlation between the task's difficulty and the model convergence speed or if they are only due to some other parameter. conclusion this paper has presented some experiments that explore correlations between humans and computer vision techniques based on deep learning ;

to evaluate graph visualization techniques. we trained models to solve tasks on several representations ( am and nl ) and compared their performances to two state - of - the - art user evaluations. our results tend to show that humans and computer vision techniques could be correlated on the considered tasks types, however additional work is needed to verify its generalization. a first improvement to deepen the experiment we ran is to enlarge its scope with more tasks of various types and use other models architectures to verify our results robustness\n\n[Chunk 2] computational cost as the input image is coded with one channel instead of three in rgb. while color is usually considered as an important visual channel, we consider it should not penalize the models because the number of grayscale colors used is quite small ( 3 ) and are not ambiguous. more generally, our nl and am representations ( i. e. layout algorithm, image drawing, absence of interactions ) were not the exact same as those from [ 12, 13 ] as their study do not provide enough details to reproduce entirely theirs. shortest path length task of okoe et al. evaluation protocol tasks, visualization techniques and hypothesis to study how the models perform on a task of higher level, we reproduced the task 10 from the evaluation of [ 27 ]. that task consists in determining the length of the shortest path between two highlighted nodes. the evaluation showed that nl performs better than am which was not contradictory with other studies evaluating that specific task ( in particular with the results of [ 12, 13 ] ). in this paper, we refer to this task as task 3. as for the first experiment, we expected our result to confirm the result of [ 27 ] : h2 : nl should outperform am for this task. graphs dataset unlike our first evaluation, the graphs we use for this experiment are those of the original study [ 27 ] ; they correspond to two real - world net - works shared in a github repository 1, along with their study setup and results. in the original experiment setup, the answers to the task 3 followed two rules : ( i ) there is always a path between the two highlighted nodes and ( ii ) the shortest path between these nodes is no more than 4. to generate as many task instances as possible ( as it is required by deep learning training processes ) while ensuring a uniform distribution of the ground - truths, we computed the number of shortest paths of length 2 to 4 for each graph. considering the two graphs of the original setup, we could extract 5593 pairs of nodes for each graph and shortest path length ( 2, 3 and 4 ). it led to 33 558 tasks instances ( 5593 pairs of nodes * 3 path lengths * 2 graphs ). this dataset is then randomly split into 3 parts : 80 % for training set, 10 % for validation set and 10 % for test set. images datasets in this experiment, we did not need to compute the graph layouts for the nl representation and the node orderings for the am one, as [ 27 ]\n\nConstraints: Use only the context.

The APR network predicts absolute 6D poses from images, while the RPR network estimates the relative pose between consecutive frames. To improve the RPR network's performance, we split the input image into zones and compute the mean value for each direction, reducing the input size and improving temporal feature memory. The output of the RPR network is then forwarded to two fully connected layers that regress the displacement and rotation. The 6D pose estimation (PE) network combines the outputs of both APR and RPR networks to predict absolute 6D poses.

Such environments typically include large warehouses or factory buildings, and localization solutions often use a combination of radio-, LiDAR-or radar-based systems, etc. However, these solutions often require infrastructure or they are costly in their operation. An alternative approach is a (mobile) optical pose estimation based on ego-motion. Such approaches are usually based on SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), meet the requirements of exact real-time localization, and are also cost-efficient. Available pose estimation approaches are categorized into three groups: classical, hybrid, and deep learning (DL)-based methods. Classical methods often require an infrastructure that includes either synthetic (i.e., installed in the environment) or natural (e.g., walls and edges) markers. The accuracy of the pose estimation depends to a large extent on suitable invariance properties of the available features such that they can be reliably recognized. However, to reliably detect features, we have to invest a lot of expensive computing time [38, 27] . Additional sensors (e.g., inertial sensors, depth cameras, etc.) or additional context (e.g., 3D models of the environment, prerecorded landmark databases, etc.) may increase the accuracy but also increase system complexity and costs [44] .

Besides well-structured elements such as high-level racks with goods, there are also very ambiguous and homogeneously textured elements (e.g., blank white or dark black walls).

The APR network predicts absolute 6D poses from images, while the RPR network estimates the relative pose between consecutive frames. To improve the RPR network's performance, we split the input image into zones and compute the mean value for each direction, reducing the input size and improving temporal feature memory. The output of the RPR network is then forwarded to two fully connected layers that regress the displacement and rotation. The 6D pose estimation (PE) network combines the outputs of both APR and RPR networks to predict absolute 6D poses.

INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK Designing efficient state representations for task and motion planning is a fundamental problem in robotics studied for several decades [1] , [2] . Traditional planning approaches rely on a comprehensive knowledge of the state of the robot and the surrounding environment. As an example, information about the robot hand and mobile base configurations as well as possible grasps is exploited in [3] to accomplish sequential manipulation tasks. The space of all possible distributions over the robot state space, called belief space, is instead employed in [4] to tackle partially observable control problems. The two most important challenges in designing state representations for robotics are high dimensionality and complex dynamics of the state space. Sampling-based planning algorithms [5] mitigate the first problem to a certain extent by randomly sampling the state space and hence avoiding representing it explicitly. However, when dealing with higher-dimensional spaces and more complex systems, such as highly deformable objects, these approaches become intractable [6] . Moreover, analytical modeling of the states of these systems and simulation of their dynamics in real time remains an open research problem [7] . For this reason, data-driven low-dimensional latent space representations for planning are receiving increasing attention as they make it possible to consider states that would otherwise be intractable. In particular, deep neural networks \n\n w ε • σ 0 (6) where w ε is a scaling parameter that can be tuned for the task at hand. The rationale behind Eq. ( 6 ) is that ε should be chosen such that similar states, captured in the no-action pairs, belong to the same valid region, while states in the action pairs are allocated to different valid regions. Using the LSR and the trained VAE-model, we can generate one or more visual plans from start to goal state. To this aim, the states are first encoded in the latent space and the closest nodes in the LSR are found. Next, all shortest paths in the LSR [22] between the identified nodes are retrieved. Finally, the class representatives of the nodes belonging to each shortest path compose the respective latent plan P z , which is then decoded into the visual plan P I . V.

Many existing tracking methods based on discriminative correlation filters (DCFs) employ feature extraction networks (FENs) to model the target appearance during the learning process. However, using deep feature maps extracted from FENs based on different residual neural networks (ResNets) has not previously been investigated. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of twelve state-of-the-art ResNet-based FENs in a DCFbased framework to determine the best for visual tracking purposes.

This constitutes a fundamental problem in many computer vision applications (e.g., self-driving cars, autonomous robots, human-computer interactions). Extracting a robust target representation is the critical component of state-of-the-art visual tracking methods to overcome these challenges. Hence, to robustly model target appearance, these methods utilize a wide range of handcrafted features (e.g., [41, 7, 87, 55, 92, 68] which exploit histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) [11] , histogram of local intensities (HOI), and Color Names (CN) [81] ), deep features from deep neural networks (e.g., [61, 63, 85, 2, 79, 40] , or both (e.g., [14, 16, 64] ). Deep features are generally extracted from either FENs (i.e., pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)) or end-to-end networks (EENs), which directly evaluate target candidates [50] . However, most EEN-based visual trackers train or fine-tune FENs on visual tracking datasets. Numerous recent visual tracking methods exploit powerful generic target representations from FENs trained on large-scale object recognition datasets, such as the ImageNet [72] . By combining deep discriminative features from FENs with efficient online learning formulations, visual trackers bas\n\nrom the DenseNet-201 model were extensively evaluated on the OTB-2013 dataset (see Fig. 2(a) ). Based on these results, the feature maps extracted from the L3 layer appeared to have achieved the best visual tracking performance in terms of average precision and success metrics. Although the original ECO tracker exploits fused deep features extracted from the first and third convolutional layers of the VGG-M network, the fusion of different levels of feature maps from the DenseNet network did not lead to better visual tracking performance. These results may help the visual trackers to prevent redundant feature maps and considerably reduce the computational complexity. In the second step, the generalization of exploiting the third convolutional layer of the DenseNet-201 model was evaluated on the DeepSTRCF tracker [48] . To ensure a fair comparison, the visual tracking performance of both the original and the proposed versions of DeepSTRCF were evaluated with the aid of only deep feature\n\n56) Features-5-3-id-relu (512) Features-6-5-id-relu (1024) ResNeXt-101 Features-2 (64) Features-4-2-id-relu (256) Features-5-3-id-relu (512) Features-6-22-id-relu (1024) SE-ResNet-50 Conv1-relu-7x7-s2 (64) Conv2-3-relu (256) Conv3-4-relu (512) Conv4-6-relu (1024) SE-ResNet-101 Conv1-relu-7x7-s2 (64) Conv2-3-relu (256) Conv3-4-relu (512) Conv4-23-relu (1024) SE-ResNeXt-50 Conv1-relu-7x7-s2 (64) Conv2-3-relu (256) Conv3-4-relu (512) Conv4-6-relu (1024) SE-ResNeXt-101 Conv1-relu-7x7-s2 (64) Conv2-3-relu (256) Conv3-4-relu (512) Conv4-23-relu (1024) DenseNet-121 Table 3 3 Exploited visual tracking datasets in this work.

To address this issue, recent bias mitigation methods for VQA propose to incorporate visual cues (e.g., human attention maps) to better ground the VQA models, showcasing impressive gains. However, we show that the performance improvements are not a result of improved visual grounding, but a regularization effect which prevents over-fitting to linguistic priors. For instance, we find that it is not actually necessary to provide proper, human-based cues; random, insensible cues also result in similar improvements. Based on this observation, we propose a simpler regularization scheme that does not require any external annotations and yet achieves near state-of-the-art performance on VQA-CPv2 1 .", "abstract_only_llm": "Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a pivotal task that aims to develop models with human-like visual and linguistic understanding. However, existing VQA models often rely on superficial statistical biases to produce responses, rather than genuinely comprehending the visual content. This raises concerns about the limitations of current VQA models in achieving true visual understanding.\nTo address this issue, researchers have been exploring ways to improve the visual understanding capabilities of VQA models. One approach involves incorporating multimodal learning mechanisms that allow models to effectively integrate visual and linguistic information. Another approach focuses on developing more robust and interpretable models that can provide explanations for their responses.\nRecent studies have shown that these approaches can lead to significant improvements in the visual understanding of VQA models. By leveraging multimodal learning and interpretability, these models can better recognize objects, scenes, and actions, and provide more accurate and informative responses to visual questions. However, more research is needed to fully understand the potential of these approaches and to develop more sophisticated VQA models that can truly rival human visual understanding.", "abstract_rag": "This study investigates the effectiveness of visual grounding based bias mitigation approaches in Visual Question Answering (VQA). Our results indicate that current methods do not suffice, suggesting that performance gains stem from spurious sources rather than proper visual grounding. We propose a simple regularization scheme that rivals state-of-the-art accuracy without requiring additional annotations. Our findings highlight the need for a more comprehensive experimental setup and datasets to evaluate the performance of visual grounding methods. We recommend reporting both train and test accuracy to verify that performance gains are not stemming from regularization effects. Furthermore, we advocate for creating a dataset with ground truth grounding available for 100% of instances using synthetically generated datasets or tasks that explicitly test grounding.

However, existing VQA models often exploit superficial statistical biases to produce responses, instead of producing the right answers for the right reasons (Kafle et al., 2019) . The VQA-CP dataset (Agrawal et al., 2018) showcases this phenomenon by incorporating different question type/answer distributions in the train and test sets. Since the linguistic priors in the train and test sets differ, models that exploit these priors fail on the test set. To tackle this issue, recent works have endeavored to enforce proper visual grounding, where the goal is to make models produce answers by looking at relevant visual regions (Gan et al., 2017; Selvaraju et al. , Recent Methods Improve by grounding on relevant regions +9% over baselines Prediction: Green Our Findings Irrelevant/random regions result in similar gains +9% over baselines 2019; Wu and Mooney, 2019) , instead of exploiting linguistic priors. These approaches rely on additional annotations/cues such as human-based attention maps (Das et al., 2017) , textual explanations (Huk Park et al., 2018) and object label predictions (Ren et al., 2015) to identify relevant regions, and train the model to base its predictions on those regions, showing large improvements (8-10% accuracy) on the VQA-CPv2 datas\n\nxed subset covering 1% of the dataset, b) Varying subset covering 1% of the dataset, where a new random subset is sampled every epoch and c) 100% of the dataset. Confirming our hypothesis, all variants of our model achieve near state-of-the-art results, solidifying our claim that the performance gains for recent methods come from regularization effects. It is also interesting to note that the drop in training accuracy is lower with this regularization scheme as compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Of course, if any model was actually visually grounded, then we would expect it to improve performances on both train and test sets. We do not observe such behavior in any of the methods, indicating that they are not producing right answers for the right reasons. Discussion on Proper Grounding While our results indicate that current visual grounding based bias mitigation approaches do not suffice, we believe this is still a good research direction. However, future methods must seek to ve\n\n (Num)' answer type, showing that methods find it difficult to answer questions that are most reliant on correct visual grounding such as: localizing and counting objects. Finally, we do not observe large improvements in 'Other' question type, most likely due to the large number of answers present under this answer type.

However, existing VQA models often rely on superficial statistical biases to produce responses, rather than genuinely comprehending the visual content. This raises concerns about the limitations of current VQA models in achieving true visual understanding.\nTo address this issue, researchers have been exploring ways to improve the visual understanding capabilities of VQA models. One approach involves incorporating multimodal learning mechanisms that allow models to effectively integrate visual and linguistic information. Another approach focuses on developing more robust and interpretable models that can provide explanations for their responses.\nRecent studies have shown that these approaches can lead to significant improvements in the visual understanding of VQA models. By leveraging multimodal learning and interpretability, these models can better recognize objects, scenes, and actions, and provide more accurate and informative responses to visual questions. However, more research is needed to fully understand the potential of these approaches and to develop more sophisticated VQA models that can truly rival human visual understanding.", "rag_queries": ["What is the main problem or motivation addressed in this paper?", "What method or approach is proposed?

As humans, by merely watching objects interact, we are able to distinguish between different object instances, reason about their physical properties, and make predictions on their future motion. More impressively, our ability to recognize, model, and predict the dynamics of physical systems applies to not only rigid bodies, but also deformable objects such as elastic materials and fluids (Bates et al., 2019) . Given the example shown in Figure 1 , humans can automatically identify the separation between liquid (water) and solid (floating cube), estimate their properties such as gravity, density, and viscosity, and predict key features of their future motion through mental simulation (Battaglia et al., 2013; Hamrick et al., 2016) . For computational systems, physical reasoning on interacting deformable objects has been a highly challenging task, due to the diverse dynamical characteristics of different materials and their interactions. Take fluid as an example: fluids can deform, separate, merge, compress, and oscillate into arbitrary shapes, and some are hard to perceive due to their transparent nature. Prior works on system identification for robotics usually make strong assumptions on the structure of the underlying system (Ljung, 2001) , or require a lot of data to train a forward model (Finn & Levine, 2017) , a\n\ne-trained dynamics prior to guide the training of the inference module without access to the ground-truth of the inferred quantities. As shown in equation 4, the dynamics model inputs the inferred quantities, including the refined position, grouping, rigidness, and physical parameters, and predicts the future positions of the particles. We take the L 1 distance between the predicted positions and ground truth as the loss function. The inference module is trained by stochastic gradient descent whose gradients are computed by back-propagating through the dynamics prior. Parameters of the dynamics prior stay frozen during training. Experiments We study our framework under three environments that incorporate different types of objects and facilitate rich interactions.

The ability to visually comprehend and identify the uniqueness of one network compared to another is crucial for informed decision-making and strategic planning.\nThis study proposes a theoretical framework for visual understanding of network comparisons, focusing on the development of a conceptual model that facilitates the identification of key differences and similarities between two networks. The framework is grounded in the principles of graph theory and visual analytics, leveraging techniques such as node-link diagrams, graph clustering, and visualization metrics.\nOur approach aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive method for visualizing network comparisons, enabling users to effectively communicate complex network relationships and identify patterns that may not be immediately apparent through numerical analysis. The framework is designed to be adaptable and extensible, allowing researchers and practitioners to incorporate additional visualization techniques and metrics as needed.\nBy providing a theoretical foundation for visual understanding of network comparisons, this study contributes to the advancement of network science and its applications in various domains, ultimately facilitating more effective and informed decision-making in real-world scenarios.", "rag_queries": ["What is the main problem or motivation addressed in this paper?", "What method or approach is proposed?

We present the MultiSegVA platform that facilitates multi-scale time series segmentation by tailored visual-interactive features, established VA principles, and a new visual query language. In this publication, we focus on biologging time series of moving animals: these time series have prototypical multi-scale character and include widely unexplored behaviors, which are hidden in high resolutions and cardinalities. Additionally, biologging-driven movement ecology is an emerging field [10, 59, 76, 77] , triggered by technical advances that enable academia to address open questions in innovative ways. The biologging time series stem from miniaturized tags and give high-resolution information about, e.g., an animal's location, tri-axial acceleration, and heart rate. Here, semantics are typically distributed on diverse temporal scales, including life stages, seasons, days, day times, and (micro)movement frames. These temporal scales are complemented by spatial scales concerning, e.g., the overall migration range, migration stops, and foraging ranges. There are\n\nqueries and code snippets. While the exact multi-scale structure is often unknown a priori, changing the nesting of a text query or code can be error-prone, relatively tedious, and commonly does not entail a compact visual representation. Further strengths (e.g., technique variability, query expressiveness) are depicted within this section. While in principle the VQL can consume any indices-serving technique, we exemplify a domain-oriented set of segmentation techniques that was derived in close collaboration with movement ecologists: see the overview with domain-specific use cases in Table 2 . Besides, the VQL also has operators to consider important relations between segments on the same scale. A multi-scale segmentation query, including techniques and possibly operators, becomes recursively parsed and evaluated in MultiSegVA's Java backend. The resulting segment tree references a segment's start and stop record index, next to child nodes. Section 5.1 specifies preconditions and the \n\ne 1 . 1 Comparison of related approaches.

see the schematic in figure 2. the experts interact with the plot, consider contextual data sources, and often try to project themselves into the animal with its motion and movements. to identify and annotate segments of the time series, the experts have to follow a manual process : segments have to be defined by a rectangle selection, before predefined behavior labels are individually assigned. at millions of records, this process can take, as reported, several months. to handle t1 - t3 while strongly reflecting the multi - scale nature of the time series, the following requirements evolved. requirements. through regular meetings with the movement ecologists, we derived requirements for the multisegva platform by means of semi - structured interviews. initially, we proposed a set of requirements, based on literature research and supported by interface sketches. these requirements were discussed and refined together with the domain experts. in the following, we describe a high - level set of requirements as result of our discussions. this set complements the requirements in [ 7 ]", "query": "What experiments or evaluation setup are used (datasets, tasks, metrics)?"}, {"vector_id": 382, "score": 0.6381937265396118, "text": "each segment of one scale with the same parameters ;

see the schematic in figure 2. the experts interact with the plot, consider contextual data sources, and often try to project themselves into the animal with its motion and movements. to identify and annotate segments of the time series, the experts have to follow a manual process : segments have to be defined by a rectangle selection, before predefined behavior labels are individually assigned. at millions of records, this process can take, as reported, several months. to handle t1 - t3 while strongly reflecting the multi - scale nature of the time series, the following requirements evolved. requirements. through regular meetings with the movement ecologists, we derived requirements for the multisegva platform by means of semi - structured interviews. initially, we proposed a set of requirements, based on literature research and supported by interface sketches. these requirements were discussed and refined together with the domain experts. in the following, we describe a high - level set of requirements as result of our discussions. this set complements the requirements in [ 7 ]"}, {"vector_id": 382, "score": 0.6381937265396118, "text": "each segment of one scale with the same parameters ;

Most past approaches to the problem have focused on facial expressions in order to determine the emotional state of the person of interest [7, 18, 22] . This is reasonable due to the fact that facial expressions have been studied extensively in the psychology and emotion literature [8] . For example, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) [9] identifies the units of facial movements, based on facial muscle groups. Combinations of the so-called action units (AUs) have also been linked with emotional states with extensions of the basic FACS such as EMFACS (Emotion FACS) [11] . On the other hand, there is no similar established coding system for body expressions, although some have been proposed [4] . Compared to facial expression based approaches, recent works have sought alternative modalities and streams of information to detect emotion; one is bodily expressions since many have highlighted the fact that the emotional state is conveyed through bodily expressions as well, and in certain emotions it is the main modality [5, 15, 26] , or can be used to correctly disambiguate the corresponding facial expression [1] .

Model Architecture Our model is based on the TSN architecture [27] , which has been widely used in action recognition and can be seen in Fig. 1 . During training, K different segments are selected from the input video, and then N consecutive frames are selected from each segment. This is done to deal with the fact that consecutive frames have usually redundant information. Traditionally, two different modalities are used, one is the spatial (RGB) modality and the second one is the optical flow.

We propose a transformer-based model to tackle this new semantic AudioGoal task, incorporating an inferred goal descriptor that captures both spatial and semantic properties of the target.

The agent needs to reason intelligently about all the senses available to it (sight, hearing, proprioception, touch) to select the proper sequence of actions in order to achieve its task. For example, a service robot of the future may need to locate and fetch an object for a user, go empty the dishwasher when it stops running, or travel to the front hall upon hearing a guest begin speaking there. Towards such applications, recent progress in visual navigation builds agents that use egocentric vision to travel to a designated point in an unfamiliar environment [23, 38, 42, 10] , search for a specified object [44, 9, 37, 8] , or explore and map a new space [35, 34, 13, 10, 15, 10, 36] . Limited new work further explores expanding the sensory suite of the navigating agent to include hearing as well. In particular, the AudioGoal challenge [11] requires an agent to navigate to a sounding target (e.g., a ringing phone) using audio for key directional and distance cues [11, 19, 12] . Figure 1 : Semantic audio-visual navigation in 3D environments: an agent must navigate to a sounding object. Since the sound may stop while the agent searches for the object, the agent is incentivized to learn the association between how objects look and sound, and to build contextual models for where different semantic sounds are more likely to occur (e.g., water dripping in the bathroom).

Previous works in the domain have often utilized classical machine learning approaches such as KNNs, SVMs, or MLPs, while a few have already used modern approaches like deep neural networks (DNNs). However, one problem in the domain is that the faults are often very small and have to be detected within a larger size of the chip or even the wafer. Therefore, small structures in the size of pixels have to be detected in a vast amount of image data. One interesting principle of the human brain for solving this problem is visual attention. Hence, we employ here a biologically plausible model of visual attention for automatic visual inspection. On this basis, we propose a hybrid system of visual attention and a deep neural network. As demonstrated, our system achieves among other decisive advantages an improvement in accuracy from 81 % to 92 %, and an increase in accuracy for detecting faults from 67 % to 88 %. Therefore, the error rates are reduced from 19 % to 8 %, and notably from 33 % to 12 % for detecting a fault in a chip. Hence, these results show that attention can greatly improve the performance of visual inspection systems. Furthermore, we conduct a broad evaluation, which identifies specific advantages of the biological attention model in this application, and benchmarks standard deep learning approaches as an alternative with and without attention. This work is an extended arXiv version of the original conference article published in \"IECON 2020\".

INTRODUCTION One long-term goal is to incorporate biological processing principles into machine vision systems. Visual attention, a smart human processing principle that focuses processing resources on an aspect of a scene relevant for the current task, is one of these biological processing principles [1, 2] . We apply this principle here to the domain of wafer dicing to investigate its benefits and under which circumstances it improves automated visual inspection systems. The long-term goal of our research is therefore to better understand the power of human processing as well as to incorporate its benefits into machine vision systems and improve them accordingly. A major aim in the domain of the semiconductor industry is to detect and recognize production errors and faults early on. As manual detection is a very labor-intensive and thus costly procedure, computer vision systems are often deployed as an automatic detection system [3, 4] . This does not only results in reduced manufacturing costs and work load, but also helps increasing the yield of the production process itself. Hence, systems for automated visual inspection are widely deployed in the industry. In this contribution, we address the topic of wafer dicing. Wafer dicing is the separation of silicon wafers into single components, e.g. chips, often using a dicing saw [5, 6] . Dicing based on laser technology is a novel alternative method to separate brittle semiconductor materials via thermally induced mechanic\n\nfine a region of interest (ROI, [17] ) of 120 % the size of the chip and 6× the width of the street around this center. The goal of our application is to detect dicing faults, which occur in the space between the streets and the chips, and possibly continue inside the chip. To cover these areas at best, the ROI was centered in such a way that the main street is placed at 1 /3 of the image height such that 2 /3 of the image shows the associated chip. Hence, the input street image contains the street itself as well as parts of adjacent chips and street crossings (Fig. 1 , right side). Regarding the design of the CNN, we indicate for the CNN the relevant chip areas inside the provided image and thus what part of the image should contain no cuts, by employing a trick from deep reinforcement learning [48] . The street regions are rotated before being passed on to the CNN, whereas the chip area is always located in the same image position (chosen as top). Thus, the position of the chip regio\n\nhout attention Table V : V Performance evaluation of classical deep neural networks from computer vision.

[ 18, 20 ] - [ 24 ]. the classical approach is that attention selects a spatial region ( region of interest, roi [ 17 ] ), which is subsequently passed to a classifier for later recognition. this idea came up at first with the saliency models in the late 1990s, which select a roi for a later classifier [ 17 ]. the classifier can of course today also be a cnn. variations of this approach are the glimpse approach from google [ 18 ], where a more modern neural network selects regions very swiftly ( glimpses ),", "query": "What is the main problem or motivation addressed in this paper?"}, {"vector_id": 1976, "score": 0.520531415939331, "text": "first model of visual attention, in combination with deep learning, for the domain of fault recognition in the semiconductor industry. there exist several approaches of combining visual attention with deep neural networks ( dnns ) in other domains already. the background behind this idea is often that attention focuses the processing on a part or an aspect or a scene, which is then passed for classification to a machine learning classifier, like a dnn. in such a way, the attention model zooms in on the content, which then the dnn classifies in higher resolution and with less irrelevant data. however, the way to combine this remains pretty unclear and under debate. we found several dominant approaches, which are listed in the following. 1 ) one approach is the saliency models [ 17 ]. the idea understands attention as a mechanism to define a spatial region ( region of interest, roi [ 17 ] ), which is then later passed to a classifier. newer work uses this idea for taking fast snapshots from the image via attention and feed them to a cnn ( glimpse approach [ 18 ] ). 2 ) as saliency models struggle with objects that are not very obvious in the image, they find the wrong regions for the dnn. this has led to a combination of this approach with machine learning like reinforcement learning [ 19 ], e. g. [ 20 ]. 3 ) similarly, a saliency model can be controlled by words to find the visual regions corresponding to text ( attention for visual - textual alignment, e. g. wang et al. [ 21 ] ). 4 ) a different approach is from jurgen schmidthuber [ 22 ], which introduces top - down feature - based attention in his model and thus uses attention towards specific features, not regions. 5 ) attention towards some basic features can also be used to select an irregularly shaped region, defined via visual features instead of a spatial region, and then feed this content to a dnn ( e. g. [ 23 ] ). 6 ) in the recent few years, works also utilize dnns, or building blocks of them, as attention networks. so, one neuronal network serves as attention network, while the other is modulated by it and processes normally the image ( e. g. [ 23 ] - [ 25 ] ). quite a few systems use this approach, but they are designed very diverse ( 5 examples : [ 23 ] - [ 27 ] ). therefore, many different approaches exist that allow the combination of visual attention with machine learning", "query": "What method or approach is proposed? Summarize the core idea and components."}, {"vector_id": 1989, "score": 0.6182888150215149, "text": ". for this, we first try to weight the loss function higher when a class is less presented in the data set, but we found that this approach gives suboptimal accuracies for such a high imbalance. hence, we tried a different approach and found that simply duplicating the samples for the underrepresented classes while applying data augmentation yields good results. the on - the - fly data augmentation ensures, despite several images are identical in the data set, that the images appear differently for the cnn after the augmentation. therefore, such an approach produces a good amount of image variations on the fly from one source image [ 23 ]. b. evaluation of the visual attention model at first, we will verify if the attention model shows plausible human behavior. as we do not posses human eye tracking data for this task, and as there is, according to our literature search, no eye tracking data available for workers performing fault recognition in the semiconductor industry, we can only analyze if the neuronal activities and eye movements of the model are reasonable under a task like this and are in line with the general literature about visual search [ 41, 45, 49 ]. for this, we first illustrated the model's behavior on a representative example, as already shown during the model's description. this serves as a qualitative analysis. afterwards, we quantify the results, i. e. the correctness of eye movements, which connotes here how many streets the attention model finds and how precise are the selected coordinates. 1 ) correctness of the found streets : at first, we quantify the number of streets found. the model of visual attention finds 98. 49 % of the existing 32 768 streets in our data set correctly, whereby the false positives were 29 of these. the localization precision per each wafer is given in tab. iii. we defined a street as not found if the extracted center coordinates are not on the chip sides ( 0. 3 < x, y < 0. 7 ) or if the roi borders are outside the image borders. the data set consists of 8 192 processable chips, and thus has a total of 32 768 street segments, based on the assumption that each chip has four street segments. the model's correctness of 98. 49 % is within the upper range of the shown accuracies

total runtime of the learning is only a few seconds on consumergrade hardware. the other advantage of the learning procedure is that the image can be defined in a rather conceptual manner, more of a sketch than an actual image ( fig. 4 ). we found that even defining the image via simple image editor software is enough. hence, it can be easily and swiftly produced. as a last advantage, the attention model can deal with the inner structures of the chips out of the box by an external spatial attention signal. this signal defines which chip areas are suppressed regarding processing. we use it to suppress the inner structure of a chip, as we know human inspectors would also not look at the middle of a chip image. to illustrate this, we use a chip with especially a lot of inner structures in fig. 4. the suppression map can again simply be defined as an image. the model naturally realizes in this way task instructions. during the processing, the initially very noisy activity is filtered, illustrated by showing the input stages towards the fef ( iv, v, vi ) : the first stage is very noisy as it reacts to all inner structures of the chip ( iv ). yet, the external spatial attention signal is then applied to this, which suppresses the \" middle \" by decreasing neuronal activity ( v ). afterwards, the competition takes place, increases the signal contrast, and reduces the activity to a few locations ( vi ). during this processing, the model filters out inner chip structures, which might be very similar to the searched streets and thus would divert the recognition process. d. improvements of the visual attention model the attention model has been modified in several ways for this work. additionally, as the attention model stems from a line of older attention models, this section provides the changes as compared to the previous works [ 2 ]. 1 ) spatial external attention signal : the model was extended with an external spatial attention signal. in the data set, some of the chips have line - like structures within the chip. we know from human workers that they were told to ignore the structures inside a chip, which translates roughly to the task instruction'do not look in the middle of a chip '. such task instructions can be naturally realized in the model by directing'negative'attention to the middle of a chip. hence, this signal realizes spatial components of task instructions. we implemented this external attention signal as an incoming signal to the frontal eye field ( fef )", "query": "What are the key contributions and

investigating how a deep neuronal network can be integrated into an attention model or vice versa in a biologically plausible way. iv ) finally, we have a complicated task - instruction here. the workers'instruction is to check the cuts for potential faults, which is of course realized by looking at the cuts ( i. e. streets ). hence, we have applied attention to the streets here. however, not a street alone need to be checked for cracks, but rather also the close region next to it, ranging from the close surrounding of the street over the street - chip border towards the inside of the

[ 20 ]. 3 ) similarly, a saliency model can be controlled by words to find the visual regions corresponding to text ( attention for visual - textual alignment, e. g. wang et al. [ 21 ] ). 4 ) a different approach is from jurgen schmidthuber [ 22 ], which introduces top - down feature - based attention in his model and thus uses attention towards specific features, not regions. 5 ) attention towards some basic features can also be used to select an irregularly shaped region, defined via visual features instead of a spatial region, and then feed this content to a dnn ( e. g. [ 23 ] ). 6 ) in the recent few years, works also utilize dnns, or building blocks of them, as attention networks. so, one neuronal network serves as attention network, while the other is modulated by it and processes normally the image ( e. g. [ 23 ] - [ 25 ] ). quite a few systems use this approach, but they are designed very diverse ( 5 examples : [ 23 ] - [ 27 ] ). therefore, many different approaches exist that allow the combination of

try to weight the loss function higher when a class is less presented in the data set, but we found that this approach gives suboptimal accuracies for such a high imbalance. hence, we tried a different approach and found that simply duplicating the samples for the underrepresented classes while applying data augmentation yields good results. the on - the - fly data augmentation ensures, despite several images are identical in the data set, that the images appear differently for the cnn after the augmentation. therefore, such an approach produces a good amount of image variations on the fly from one source image [ 23 ]. b. evaluation of the visual attention model at first, we will verify if the attention model shows plausible human behavior. as we do not posses human eye tracking data for this task, and as there is, according to our literature search, no eye tracking data available for workers performing fault recognition in the semiconductor industry, we can only analyze if the neuronal activities and eye movements of the model are reasonable under a task like this and are in line with the general literature about visual search [ 41, 45, 49 ]. for this, we first illustrated the model's behavior on a representative example, as already shown during the model's description. this serves as a qualitative analysis. afterwards, we quantify the results, i. e. the correctness of eye movements, which connotes here how many streets the attention model finds and how precise are the selected coordinates. 1 ) correctness of the found streets : at first, we quantify the number of streets found. the model of visual attention finds 98. 49 % of the existing 32 768 streets in our data set correctly, whereby the false positives were 29 of these. the localization precision per each wafer is given in tab. iii. we defined a street as not found if the extracted center coordinates are not on the chip sides ( 0. 3 < x, y < 0. 7 ) or if the roi borders are outside the image borders. the data set consists of 8 192 processable chips, and thus has a total of 32 768 street segments, based on the assumption that each chip has four street segments. the model's

seconds on consumergrade hardware. the other advantage of the learning procedure is that the image can be defined in a rather conceptual manner, more of a sketch than an actual image ( fig. 4 ). we found that even defining the image via simple image editor software is enough. hence, it can be easily and swiftly produced. as a last advantage, the attention model can deal with the inner structures of the chips out of the box by an external spatial attention signal. this signal defines which chip areas are suppressed regarding processing. we use it to suppress the inner structure of a chip, as we know human inspectors would also not look at the middle of a chip image. to illustrate this, we use a chip with especially a lot of inner structures in fig. 4. the suppression map can again simply be defined as an image. the model naturally realizes in this way task instructions. during the processing, the initially very noisy activity is filtered, illustrated by showing the input stages towards the fef ( iv, v, vi ) : the first stage is very noisy as it reacts to all inner structures of the chip ( iv ). yet, the external spatial attention signal is then applied to this, which suppresses the \" middle \" by decreasing neuronal activity ( v ). afterwards, the competition takes place, increases the signal contrast, and reduces the activity to a few locations ( vi ). during this processing, the model filters out inner chip structures, which might be very similar to the searched streets and thus would divert the recognition process. d. improvements of the visual attention model the attention model has been modified in several ways for this work. additionally, as the attention model stems from a line of older attention models, this section provides the changes as compared to the previous works [ 2 ]. 1 ) spatial external attention signal : the model was extended with an external spatial attention signal. in the data set, some of the chips have line - like structures within the chip. we know from human workers that they were told to ignore the structures inside a chip, which translates roughly to the task instruction'do not look in the middle of a chip '. such task instructions can be naturally realized in the model by directing'negative'attention to the middle of a chip. hence, this signal realizes spatial components of task instructions. we implemented this external attention signal as an incoming signal to the frontal eye field ( fef )"}]}, "rag_prompt": "You are writing an academic abstract using the provided context.\nKeyword: visual_understanding\n\nContext:\n[Chunk 1] of the newer approach is that the region can be shaped more clearly and flexibly. however, this big gain is in our wafer application of not much benefit, as the most structures in our image material are anyway rectangles. iii ) despite the approach's closer similarity to the brain's functionality, the neuroscientific review literature also reveals that the effects of attention are much more complex than a simple'enhance attended'or'suppress all others'[ 32, 33 ]. as we aim for a strong biological plausibility, we would not like to ignore these effects lighthearted, and rather aim for a separate research publication investigating how a deep neuronal network can be integrated into an attention model or vice versa in a biologically plausible way. iv ) finally, we have a complicated task - instruction here. the workers'instruction is to check the cuts for potential faults, which is of course realized by looking at the cuts ( i. e. streets ). hence, we have applied attention to the streets here. however, not a street alone need to be checked for cracks, but rather also the close region next to it, ranging from the close surrounding of the street over the street - chip border towards the inside of the chip. therefore, the workers'task requires to transfer from the attended structure ( streets ) to another spatial area. as it is not really known how such task instructions are realized in the brain, we do not know how to implement this in the attention model. the region of interest approach instead solves this problem out - of - the - box. therefore, we evaluate it is better to use the region of interest approach, which solves the problem nicely and has advantages in our case. v. conclusion and outlook in this contribution, we propose a novel system for automated visual fault detection by combining a biologicallyplausible model of visual attention with a deep neural network. the process of automated visual fault detection in the domain of semiconductor manufacturing and laser - based wafer dicing constitutes one particularly challenging application area, as defect patterns often range within a size of only a few pixels / µm. this problem is challenging for traditional convolutional neuronal networks, and it is getting more challenging due to the heterogeneity and imbalance of the image material. visual attention is well suited for this problem, but not much used in the semiconductor industry yet, for which we created the first deep learning system with attention. our benchmark shows that visual attention improves the mean\n\n[Chunk 2] visual attention. this illustrates that attention is a crucial principle and promotes its idea of zooming in. surprisingly, the standard networks do not cope with attention very well, seen as the accuracies for the streets are lower than with our customized network. that implies the standard deep networks profit less from attention. furthermore, transfer learning [ 10 ] benefits even less from attention. we suppose that is because in the original data set ( imagenet ), the objects are not shown in high resolution or large sizes like the faults in our street regions, hence the image material does not transfer well enough to our use case. hence, our conclusion here is that visual attention is able to show its strengths much better if it is not mixed with transfer learning. this is reasonable since the data material is different. therefore, we conclude that our proposed system improves and outperforms, as evaluated in comparison, current state - ofthe - art solutions in the wafer dicing domain. other standard deep neural network approaches show also lower accuracy percentages, and we evaluate generally the benefits of visual attention. d. performance of the whole system finally, the class of a chip is calculated from the classification of its four street regions. the full system reaches the following accuracy to classify the chips correctly : 91 %. this rate would be the important one for a final production system. the result of the classified streets and chip error classes can then be illustrated, here as ground truth, as in fig. 7. it comprises the street and chip classification test results for good ( • ), anomaly ( • ) and faulty ( • ) streets and chips according to the used addressing scheme of the wafer. the shown error classes can then continue to differ in their respective defect pattern to be further assessed by an inspector. iv. discussion about how to couple a visual attention model with a cnn several

Scene retrieval extends image retrieval to classification of scenes defined at test time by associating a single query image to reference images of scene classes. Our second contribution is a triplet-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to address this problem which increases scene classification accuracy by up to 7% against state-of-the-art networks pre-trained for scene recognition. The second contribution is an algorithm 'DMC' that combines our scene classification with distance and memorability for visual mapping. Our analysis shows that DMC includes 64% more images of our chosen scene classes in a visual map than just using distance interval mapping.

Of these approaches only memorability includes images in the visual map according to any explicit, external image criteria.

In contrast our approach allows a user to increase localization accuracy requirements for target scene classes by providing examples of them to classify incoming images against. The resulting visual map includes more instances of Fig. 1 . DMC combines distance, memorability and context from scene retrieval for contextual visual mapping to include more user defined classes in visual maps the target scene classes compared to selecting them using memorability or distance intervals. The improved visual maps then allow more accurate localization of those scene classes. Scene classes (Figure 2 ) are selected by the user according to the environment and task at hand.

specific visual mapping, where a visual map is defined as a collection of images used to represent a geographical area. two current approaches could be used for scene classification. 1 ) scene recognition : scene recognition is classification of scenes defined at training time. a classifier could be trained on our scene classes. however, the visual overlap between classes from a single visual map made this very challenging. it would also need to be re - trained if the scene classes or visual map environment were to change. 2 ) visual place recognition : vpr is defined as image retrieval. a descriptor is used to represent a query image which can then be classified by comparing it to an unlimited amount of individual user - defined classes ( i. e. scenes ) represented using the same type of descriptor. 3 ) scene retrieval : scene retrieval is defined as : classification of overlapping scene classes defined at test time. this also requires a solution that does not need re - training for each class or new environment and is different from vpr because it is designed to match images of one scene class ( i. e. roundabout ) and multiple images of different scene classes ( i. e. roundabouts, bus stops, etc. ) rather than to match two individual scene images in different visual conditions. this paper's solution uses triplet loss to train a neural network to generate embedded descriptors for scene classes. at test time the reference scene class whose embedded descriptors are, on average, the shortest euclidean distance from the query image's descriptor is used as the classification result ( figure 3 ). scene retrieval is a challenging problem that is only introduced in this paper so we confine ourselves to taking reference images of each scene class from one dataset and comparing them against the remaining, previously unseen, scene images from the same dataset. this simulates a user hand labelling a limited subset of scene classes in a dataset and then using them to identify the remaining examples of those scene classes. scenes from other", "query": "What method or approach is proposed?

: the vast majority of scene recognition approaches do not consider open set classification, but specifically for this task the model should be able to identify'undefined'images that do not belong to any scene class. open set classification for scene recognition and vpr remains a very challenging area, but for completeness the results were included as an aside in table i and table ii. the'undefined'class was trained as a scene class of its own. when training p2 a'undefined'class was not available, which may help explain that network's poor open set classification accuracy. there is scope for using triplet learning to address this problem, as in [ 35 ]. b. visual mapping : which approach maps the most target scene classes? for this experiment the st. lucia dataset was left untouched and the nordland dataset was mapped at intervals of 100m to reduce computational load, resulting in a dataset of 6, 546 images. tunnel interiors were also removed from nordland. approximately 10 % of both datasets consisted of scene classes. one of the three traversals of each dataset was randomly selected for mapping and the visual map size was fixed to 50 % of", "query": "What experiments or evaluation setup are used (datasets, tasks, metrics)?"}, {"vector_id": 1794, "score": 0.49118879437446594, "text": "output of the scene retrieval pipeline is a scene classification and the average distance between the test image descriptor and that reference scene image descriptors, this is called the confidence score. for contextual mapping, if a frame's confidence score was above a defined threshold and it was not classified as an'undefined'class image it was added to the visual map. e. visual mapping : combining distance, memorability and context,'dmc'contextual mapping alone creates a visual map of only scene images so it was combined with distance and memorability ( algorithm 1 ) to ensure the map covers a wide area and consists of suitable images for localization at undefined scene classes. a query image's contextual confidence score is biased by its memorability, if it is below a threshold then it is added to the map. otherwise, images are added if they are above the memorability threshold and a minimum distance has been moved, or if the distance moved exceeds a maximum threshold. iv. experiments a. scene retrieval : how accurate is scene classification?

way junctions, and t - junctions. for nordland the scene classes were bridges, level crossings, stations and tunnels. for tunnels both the approach and exit from the tunnel was used, when there was a sufficient view of the outside. bridge classes in nordland were from passing under bridges. scene classes were hand labelled in both datasets b. scene retrieval : problem formulation classification of scenes defined at test time is needed to provide context for task - specific visual mapping, where a visual map is defined as a collection of images used to represent a geographical area. two current approaches could be used for scene classification. 1 ) scene recognition : scene recognition is classification of scenes defined at training time. a classifier could be trained on our scene classes. however, the visual overlap between classes from a single visual map made this very challenging. it would also need to be re - trained if the scene classes or visual map environment were to change. 2 ) visual place recognition : vpr is defined as image retrieval. a descriptor is used to represent a query image which can then be classified by comparing it to an unlimited amount of individual user - defined classes ( i. e. scenes ) represented using the same type of descriptor. 3 ) scene retrieval : scene retrieval is defined as : classification of overlapping scene classes defined at test time. this also requires a solution that does not need re - training for each class or new environment and is different from vpr because it is designed to match images of one scene class ( i. e. roundabout ) and multiple images of different scene classes ( i. e. roundabouts, bus stops, etc. ) rather than to match two individual scene images in different visual conditions. this paper's solution uses triplet loss to train a neural network to generate embedded descriptors for scene classes. at test time the reference scene class whose embedded descriptors are, on average, the shortest euclidean distance from the query image's descriptor is used as the classification result ( figure 3 ). scene retrieval is a challenging problem that is only introduced in this paper so we confine ourselves to taking reference images of each scene class from one dataset and comparing them against the remaining, previously unseen, scene images from the same dataset. this simulates a user hand labelling a limited subset of scene classes in a dataset and then using them to identify the remaining examples of those scene classes. scenes from other\n\nConstraints: Use only the context.

A popular task that has received a considerable amount of attention is visual navigation [3, 5, 8, 29, 39, 48] , where the goal is to navigate towards a specific coordinate or object within an unseen environment. One of the common implicit assumptions for these navigation methods is that the scene is static, and the agent cannot interact with the objects to change their pose. Consider the scenario that the path of the agent towards the target location is blocked by an obstacle (e.g., a chair) as shown in Fig. 1 (top). To reach the target, the agent has to move the obstacle out of the way. Therefore, planning for reaching the target requires not only understanding the outcome of agent actions but also the dynamics of agentobject interactions. There are many factors such as object size, spatial relationship with other objects in the scene, and reaction of the object to the applied forces, that influence the outcome of the interaction with the object. Hence, longhorizon planning for navigation conditioned on the object dynamics offers unique challenges that are often overlooked in the recent navigation literature. The first challenge is to learn whether an action affects the pose of an object or not. Navigation actions (e.g., rotate right or move ahead) typically do not affect the position of objects in the world coordin\n\nein the first 20 scenes are used for training, the next 5 for validation, and the last 5 for testing in each scene category. To collect the datasets, we use 20 categories of objects such as Chair, SideTable, and DogBed. Please see Sec. B for the used objects. These objects are used as obstacles for ObsNav and as objects that should be displaced in ObjPlace. These objects are spawned on the floor for the downstream tasks. For each object category we have 5 different variations. We randomly select the first 4 variations to collect the training and validation data and use the 5th variation to collect the test data. To generate the dataset for ObsNav, we utilize an undirected graph to compute the path from the agent's starting location to the target location. Then, we randomly spawn an object to block the path. To ensure that there is no way that the agent can directly reach the target location without moving an object, we repeat this process until there is no path between the agent's star\n\necture of the visual encoder, goal embedding, and policy network. 1 → 24 →Figure 11 : 12411 Figure 11: Detailed architecture of the NIE model.

The sheer amount, as well as the intertwined structures it is comprised of, pose challenging problems when trying to analyze communication dynamics. Questions such as-what are the patterns underlying the communication network or who are key players?-are difficult to answer. They not only require the extraction of simple information from these communication datasets, but also the fine-grained analysis of the communication network structure itself to detect patterns in the bi-directional communication behavior between users. Addressing these questions, a variety of approaches were proposed, mainly, with a focus on social network analysis. Examples include the identification of key people in networks or the automatic detection of community structures [XSL11, XKS13, PBN17] . In the field of automatic text analysis, text content is examined more closely, for example using sentiment analysis [PL08] , topic modeling [EASS * 18], or lexical chaining [GREA15] . However, a problem that has not yet received enough attention is how people communi-cate with each other, i.e., a detailed exploration of the bi-directional interactions within a network.

In total there are 332,334 messages between 24,929 members of the institution. Using communication density, we present a communication sequence visualization that enables identification of regions with low or high communication behavior. This communication sequence visualization also highlights the individual communication episodes. Finally, we introduce an interactive component that allows the user to manually filter the episodes as well as label existing episodes in order to perform a semi-automatic classification of the communication episodes into user-defined classes. In order to look at the conversational dynamics in detail, we need to inspect the temporal patterns of incoming and outgoing messages more closely. To help with this, we have developed a visualization of the communication sequences between entities. To represent this conversational dynamic, we can use the communication density f , defined above. We plot\n\nthe connection between the entities in a social network graph. Following our VA approach the user can also influence this weight by filtering nonrelevant communication episodes. This weighting can than be used to steer community detection algorithms such as SLPAw or as an input for graph layout algorithms to visualize the social network structure. Thus, with previously presented idea to include further domain-specific concepts, such as message content, community detection or layout algorithms could be further steered for answering questions such as whether discussions about relevant topics have taken place between users.

We find that people can make meaningful compositional generalizations from just a few examples in a variety of scenarios, and we develop a Bayesian program induction model that provides a close fit to the behavioral data.

Early in development, children can make meaningful generalizations from just one or few positive examples of a new word (Smith et al., 2002; F.", "only_llm_body": "Introduction Humans have a remarkable capacity to learn new concepts from limited data. Early in development, children can make meaningful generalizations from just one or few positive examples of a new word (Smith et al., 2002; F. Xu & Tenenbaum, 2007) , an ability known as few-shot learning. Critical to few-shot learning is compositional generalization, the reuse and manipulation of preexisting knowledge of parts and relations to understand novel combinations (e.g., Biederman, 1987) . For example, people who are familiar with coffee maker, toaster oven and griddle can effortlessly grasp the concept of breakfast machine upon seeing it for the first time (Fig. 1A ). 1 On the other hand, computer vision models, while highly successful in many applications, are far more limited in their abilities to form compositional generalizations (Lake et al., 2017) . For instance, a pre-trained ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016) classifies the new concept in Fig. 1A as a \"waffle iron,\" whereas a strong image captioning system (K. Xu et al., 2015) describes it as \"a close up of a toaster oven with some muffins in it.\" There are qualitatively different types of composition present in real-world visual concepts, posing a challenging learning problem that demands manipulating parts and relations at various levels of abstraction (see examples in Fig. 1B ). A concept like bicycle stipulates a fixed configuration of parts and relations (e.g. bikes have handlebars, a seat, and two wheels in a consistent \n\nnd component P(h), the prior probability of a concept, can be naturally derived from the grammar (Goodman et al., 2008) . Since each production of the grammar is a sequence of expansions of non-terminals, the probability of the production is the product of the probabilities associated with each expansion. This formulation operationalizes an important psychological preference for simplicity (Chater & Vitányi, 2003) as shorter programs require fewer multiplications of expansion probabilities. To generate a model prediction for each test item y after making a set of observations, we calculate the probability that the label l y ∈ {0, 1} of y is consistent with the set of observed examples X as P(l y = 1|X) = ∑ h∈H P(l y = 1|h)P(h|X) where H is the hypothesis space considered in our study. Approximate posterior inference was implemented in the LOTlib3 software package (Piantadosi, 2014) . For each trial, we ran three Monte Carlo chains for 100,000 steps of a treeregeneration Markov chain Mo\n\nodel predictions on four of the trial types used in Experiment 2. The set of training examples is shown on the top of each panel; examples of test items were shown at the bottom. Identity test items are identical to one of the examples; Part test items are parts that appeared in one of examples; Novel configurations items were new configurations of parts in examples; Novel part items were conceptually consistent with examples but contained unseen parts; Higher-level items were configurations with one of examples as subpart; No repetition, No common and Other items in B,C and D were conceptually inconsistent with examples; Wider items in D are samples from a wider concept for which the set of possible extensions is a superset of the concept of interest.

Prior work attempts to remove reverberation based on the audio modality only. Our idea is to learn to dereverberate speech from audio-visual observations. The visual environment surrounding a human speaker reveals important cues about the room geometry, materials, and speaker location, all of which influence the precise reverberation effects. We introduce Visually-Informed Dereverberation of Audio (VIDA), an end-to-end approach that learns to remove reverberation based on both the observed monaural sound and visual scene. In support of this new task, we develop a large-scale dataset SoundSpaces-Speech that uses realistic acoustic renderings of speech in real-world 3D scans of homes offering a variety of room acoustics.

While reverberation bestows a realistic sense of spatial context, it also can degrade a listener's experience. In particular, the quality of human speech is greatly affected by reverberant environments-as illustrated by how difficult it can be to parse the words of a family member speaking loudly from another room in the house, a tour guide describing the artwork down the hall of a magnificent cavernous cathedral, or a colleague participating in a Zoom call from a cafe. Consistent with the human perceptual experience, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems noticeably suffer when given reverberant speech input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] . Thus there is great need for intelligent dereverberation algorithms that can strip away reverb effects for speech enhancement, recognition, and other downstream tasks, which could in turn benefit many applications in teleconferencing, assistive hearing devices, augmented reality, and video indexing. The audio community has made steady progress devising machine learning solutions to tackle speech dereverberation [6, 7, 8, 4, 9, 10, 11] . The general approach is to take a reverberant speech signal, usually represented with a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrogram, and feed it as input to a model that estimates a clean version of the signal with the reverberation removed. Pas\n\n within the environment. The depth image contains information about the geometry of the environment and arrangement of objects, while the RGB image contains more information about their material composition. To better model these different information sources, we use two separate ResNet18 [64] networks to extract their features, i.e. er = fr(Ir) and e d = f d (I d ). We concatenate er and e d channel-wise and feed the result to a 1x1 convolution layer fc(•) to reduce the number of total channels to 512 followed by a subsequent pooling layer f l (•) to reduce the spatial dimension, resulting in the output vector ec = f l (fc([er; e d ])). Dereverberation Network. To recover the clean speech audio, we use the UNet [65] architecture, a fully convolutional network often used for image segmentation. We first use the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to convert the reverberant input audio Ar to a complex spectrogram Sr. We treat Sr as a 2-dimensional, 2-channel image, where the horizontal \n\n r to a UNet encoder, tile and concatenate ec with the encoder's output, then use the UNet decoder to predict the clean spectrogram Ŝi s . During inference, we stitch the predicted spectrogams back into a full spectrogram and use Griffin-Lim [63] to reconstruct the output dereverberated waveform.

Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between visual and auditory cues, with implications for the design of more effective audio systems and spatial audio applications. Ultimately, this research seeks to improve our understanding of how visual understanding can be leveraged to enhance the listening experience in reverberant environments, and to inform the development of more sophisticated audio processing techniques.", "rag_queries": ["What is the main problem or motivation addressed in this paper?", "What method or approach is proposed?

One widely used approach towards this goal is to visualize unit responses via activation maximization. These synthetic feature visualizations are purported to provide humans with precise information about the image features that cause a unit to be activated -an advantage over other alternatives like strongly activating natural dataset samples. If humans indeed gain causal insight from visualizations, this should enable them to predict the effect of an intervention, such as how occluding a certain patch of the image (say, a dog's head) changes a unit's activation. Here, we test this hypothesis by asking humans to decide which of two square occlusions causes a larger change to a unit's activation. Both a large-scale crowdsourced experiment and measurements with experts show that on average the extremely activating feature visualizations by Olah et al. [40] indeed help humans on this task (68 ± 4 % accuracy; baseline performance without any visualizations is 60 ± 3 %). However, they do not provide any substantial advantage over other visualizations (such as e.g. dataset samples), which yield similar performance (66±3 % to 67±3 % accuracy). Taken together, we propose an objective psychophysical task to quantify the benefit of unit-level interpretability methods for humans, and find no evidence that a widely-used feature visualization method provides humans with better \"causal understanding\" of unit activations than simple alternative visualizations. 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021).", "abstract_only_llm": "The growing reliance on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in various applications has led to concerns about their lack of transparency and interpretability.

Many of today's best-performing machine learning models, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are also among the most mysterious ones with regards to their internal information processing. CNNs typically consist of dozens of layers with hundreds or thousands of units that distributively process and aggregate information until they reach their final decision at the topmost layer. Shedding light onto the inner workings of deep convolutional neural networks has been a long-standing quest that has so far produced more questions than answers. One of the most popular tools for explaining the behavior of individual network units is to visualize unit responses via activation maximization [16, 33, 38, 35, 39, 36, 54, 15] . The idea is to start with an image (typically random noise) and iteratively change pixel values to maximize the activation of a particular network unit via gradient ascent. The resulting synthetic images, called feature visualizations, often show interpretable structures, and are believed to isolate and highlight exactly those features that \"cause\" a unit's response [40, 50] . Some of the synthetic feature visualizations appear quite intuitive and precise. As shown in Fig. 1A , they might facilitate distinguishing whether, for example, a unit responds to just an eye or a whole dog's face. However, other aspects cast a more critical li\n\nne dot per combination of layers, branch and image set. For an alternative visualization see Appx. Fig. 16 . baseline condition where humans are not shown any visualization at all, and similar to that of other visualization methods such as simple dataset samples. Further, by-trial decisions show systematic but fairly low agreement between participants. Finally, task performance depends on the unit choice, image selections and activation differences between query images. These results add quantitative evidence against the generally-assumed usefulness of feature visualizations for understanding the causes of CNN unit activations. Our counterfactual-inspired task is the first quantitative evaluation of whether feature visualizations support causal understanding of unit activations, but it is certainly not the only possible way to evaluate causal understanding.

( 2 ) instead of testing 45 units used in the original experiment i, we only test one single branch of each inception module, namely the 3 × 3 kernel size. this is a reasonable decision given that the main finding of the superiority of natural over synthetic images was present in all branches and that there was no significant difference per condition between different branches. ( 3 ) we exchange the within - participant design for a between - participant design, i. e. one mturk participant does one condition only, namely either the natural or synthetic reference condition. this version is more suitable for short online experiments. ( 4 ) instead of testing 10 participants in the lab, we test 130 mturk participants per condition, i. e. 260 in total. this number of participants is estimated with an a priori power analysis using the simr package [ 23"}, {"vector_id": 762, "score": 0.5803992748260498, "text": "main block. the instructions extensively explain a hand - crafted example trial ( see appx. fig. 9 and 10 ). the blocks of 4 practice trials each - which are randomly sampled from a pool of 10 trials - have to be repeated until reaching 100 % performance ; except in the none condition, as there is no obvious ground truth due to the absence of reference images. finally, 18 main trials follow that are randomly interleaved with a total of 3 obvious catch trials. while feedback is provided during practice trials, no feedback is provided in the other trials. at the end, participants can share comments via an optional free - text field. across all conditions, all participants see the same query images for the instruction, practice and catch trials. in contrast, the query images differ across participants in the main trials : in each reference image condition, we test 10 different sets of query images, each responded to by 5 different mturk participants, hence 50 hits per condition. the order of the main and catch trials per participant is randomly arranged, and identical across conditions. each mturk participant takes part in only one reference image condition ( i. e. reference images are a between - participants factor ). for more details, see appx. sec. a. 1. 4. ensuring high - quality data in an online experiment to ensure that the data we collect in our online experiment is of high quality, we take two measures : ( 1 ) we integrate hidden checks which were set before data collection. only if a participant passes all five of them do we include his / her data in our analysis. first, these exclusion criteria comprise a performance threshold on the practice trials as well as a maximum number of blocks a participant may attempt. further, they include a performance threshold for catch trials, a minimum image choice variability as well as a minimum time spent on both the instructions and the whole experiment. for more details, see appx. sec. a. 1. 1.

They have been successfully employed in a variety of visual understanding tasks such as action recognition, image classification, pose estimation and visual search [4] . Most of them gain high-level understanding by identifying the objects in view based on visual input. However, reliable visual scene understanding requires not only recognition-level but also cognition-level visual understanding, and seamless integration of them. More specifically, it is desirable to identify the objects of interest to infer their actions, intents and mental states with an aim of having a comprehensive and reliable understanding of the visual input. While this is a natural task for humans, existing visual understanding systems suffer from a lack of ability for higher-order cognition inference [5] . To improve the cognition-level visual understanding, recent research in visual understanding has shifted inference from recognition-level to cognition-level which contains more complex relationship inferences. This directly leads to four major directions on cognition-level visual understanding research: 1) image generation [6] , which aims at generating images from given text description; 2) image caption [7] , which focuses on generating text description from given images; 3) visual question answering, which aims at predicting correct\n\nt relationship between image-response representations grounded r and image-query representations grounded q. For example in Figure 1 , both \" [1] \" in the question (\"How is [1] feeling about [0] on the phone\") and \"She\" in the answer (\"She is listing attentively\") refer to identical person 1, but such implicit information is not learnable at VG stage. This unit accounts for such implicit correlations among grounded r and grounded q. Note that attention can also be guided between grounded q and o. However, grounded q contains much lesser information than grounded r as query normally entails lesser words and could be inferred from responses. Such an attention is therefore not considered to simplify the model with limited information loss. In the following, we will discuss the details of the proposed guided attention unit. A guided attention unit is composed of a multi-head attention layer and a feedforward layer.

Different types of user assistance can be applied to extend the power of VA, enhance the user's experience, and broaden the audience for VA. Although different approaches to visualization onboarding and guidance in VA already exist, there is a lack of research on how to design and integrate them in effective and efficient ways.

analysis in the financial domain. a data journalist who writes for a financial newspaper can perform the same tasks for analysis as an investor, but only to gather information for publication, without the commitment of trading and therefore without the risk. this is an important distinction because it is evident that both visualization onboarding and guidance for these two users ( the data journalist and the investor ) in an ideal scenario would be similar, but cannot be the same. when a task involves taking an action with risk, this should be reflected both in visualization onboarding ( e. g., guaranteeing that the risk and its factors are clearly communicated ) and guidance ( e. g., providing options and plans to reduce the risk ). risk, together with the two core aspects discussed previously - time and profit - characterize the financial domain well as dimensions of analysis. time and money are exchangeable resources and risk modulates the efficiency or control of these exchanges. virtually all tasks in the financial domain involve estimating time - profit - risk relations between entities ( stocks, commodities, contracts, currencies, players, one's portfolio

tasks that can be predominantly associated with fa and ta, respectively : building a portfolio, and swing trading. figures 9 and 10 show two desktops configured to perform the respective task within profit. in the first example, a stock is bought and held for a long period of time, to be sold for a small but safe margin of profit ( fig. 13 ( a ) ). the average value of a stock's price tends to increase slowly over time, so holding will probably result in gains even against local lows and fluctuations ( i. e., the two drops in price between buying and selling ). swing trading, on the other hand, tries to use these fluctuations to benefit on many \" buy low, sell high \" trades over time, having a higher profit margin potential ( fig. 13 ( b ) ). both personalized desktops shown in

deals with understanding the visual mapping [ 10 ] and the interaction with the va environment. by avoiding confusion about how to use the provided interaction features, or which effects these interactions have, onboarding as well as guidance can fill a knowledge gap regarding the visualization or the interactions. when dealing with interactive visual representations, onboarding mainly addresses problems related to understanding the visual encoding and the interaction concepts, performing tasks, and understanding relationships within the data. typically, onboarding methods aim to fill this knowledge gap by using contextual menus, labels, or tutorials, so that the user can understand their use and function [ 61 ]. in contrast, guidance deals mainly with formalizing and structuring execution plans using these controls and interaction means as building blocks. thus, guidance might be used to help the user gain new insights from the visualized data, e. g., by highlighting deviations from normal medical conditions in the blood test data indicating a specific disease. analytical knowledge : this knowledge is necessary to understand the analytical methods that are used by the given va approach and how to set the parameters ( e. g., machine learning techniques for prediction or classification ). the user needs to have a basic understanding of the analytical methods and their characteristics in order to be able to effectively choose, parameterize, or utilize them. this is where onboarding techniques come into play [ 61 ]. they establish a basic understanding and introduce the user to the different possibilities of the analytical methods. furthermore, assisting the user in choosing the most appropriate of these analytical methods and parameters with respect to the task at hand [ 8 ] is a typical usage scenario for guidance. sometimes, this might also include the comparison of performance metrics or an estimation of user preferences. in this work, we describe how user assistance can benefit from explicit knowledge sources and contribute to the generation of new knowledge and insights. based on the previously

lafon [ 5 ], models can exhibit three types of characteristics : ( 1 ) descriptive : the ability to describe a wide range of existing methods ; ( 2 ) evaluative : enable the assessment of multiple design alternatives, and ( 3 ) generative : help in designing new methods. our proposed model is of the descriptive kind ( see section 4 ), as it has the ability to systematically describe and present relevant aspects of visualization onboarding and guidance. lessons learned from building the descriptive model : thus, our model helps visualization designers who can use it as a blueprint for future va tools integrating visualization onboarding and guidance components. first of all, they can decide on how and when to integrate visualization onboarding or / and guidance into their va system ( see figure 2 ). on the machine side of the descriptive model ( figure 1 ), the designer can see that the data, for example, can serve as an input for the planned onboarding. furthermore, s / he can decide on how to provide the onboarding perceived by the user through integrating visual cues, for example. limitations one limitation of the model is that it does not provide a step - by - step architecture ( e. g., design patterns, algorithms, data structures ) or concrete design guidelines for visualization onboarding and guidance concepts ( e. g., instructional material in the form of videos, texts, etc., highlighting concepts for leading the focus to interesting elements in the va system ). since this model is a high - level blueprint, another limitation is the possible depth of describing the user's cognitive processes, perception, and tacit knowledge generation. moreover, additional research needs to be carried out to extend the model beyond its descriptive nature shorting is allowed, all movements can be turned into profit, but at a higher risk. the rectangles encapsulate the space where each position is open, and can be cues to understand the risk in each situation. profit can be determined by the difference in price between entering and exiting operations, the orange arrows, which is essentially their vertical component,"}], "What experiments or evaluation setup are used (datasets, tasks, metrics)?": [{"vector_id": 344, "score": 0.638378381729126, "text": "under the scope of this umbrella, but they do not fully characterize what can be considered data analysis in the financial domain. a data journalist who writes for a financial newspaper can perform the same tasks for analysis as an investor, but only to gather information for publication, without the commitment of trading and therefore without the risk. this is an important distinction because it is evident that both visualization onboarding and guidance for these two users ( the data journalist and the investor ) in an ideal scenario would be similar, but cannot be the same. when a task involves taking an action with risk, this should be reflected both in visualization onboarding ( e. g., guaranteeing that the risk and its factors are clearly communicated ) and guidance ( e. g., providing options and plans to reduce the risk ). risk, together with the two core aspects discussed previously - time and profit - characterize the financial domain well as dimensions of analysis. time and money are exchangeable resources and risk modulates the efficiency or control of these exchanges. virtually all tasks in the financial domain involve estimating time - profit - risk relations between entities ( stocks, commodities, contracts, currencies, players, one's portfolio ), which amounts to understanding the environment, and then maybe performing an action that alters that state ( placing a buy or sell order ). since the market is a chaotic system, it is impossible to fully understand the environment and the consequences of one's actions, so all measurements and actions contain some uncertainty. in our example, the users of the profit tool are investors performing two tasks : building a portfolio and swing trading. in figure 9 and 10, we provide the respective desktop to do the specific tasks. the goal of building a portfolio is to select promising stable stocks that the investor will hold for a long time before selling. a user building a portfolio performs an exploratory analysis to find good candidate stocks, and the presented desktop is optimized to help him or her find them. on the right -

The spatial geometry of our surroundings, the materials that comprise objects and surfaces, and the locations of sound sources significantly influence how we perceive auditory stimuli. As a result, the same sound is perceived differently depending on the acoustic properties of the environment and our location within it. This phenomenon has significant implications for fields such as architecture, acoustics, and psychology, where understanding how our environment shapes our perception is crucial.\nBy examining the interplay between visual and auditory perception, this research aims to shed light on the cognitive processes that underlie our experience of space and sound. The study will investigate how the physical environment affects our ability to understand and interpret visual information, and how this, in turn, influences our auditory perception.

located with i t's camera. our goal is thus to learn a function f such that f ( a s, i t ) = a t. the microphone co - location is important because acoustic properties vary as the listener location changes ; inconsistent camera locations would lead to a perceived mismatch between the visuals and acoustics. the space s can have arbitrary acoustic characteristics, from an anechoic recording studio to a concert hall with significant reverberation. we assume there is one sounding object, leaving the handling of background sounds or interference as future work. importantly, our task formulation does not assume access to the impulse response, nor does it require the input audio to be anechoic. in comparison, the im -

( 1 ) not all feature map units can contribute equally to the model's prediction, and some of these units may be misleading in some instances ( see figure 3a ). ( 2 ) as bau et al. [ 5 ] pointed out, cnns trained for a specific purpose may encounter the emergence of disentangled representations unrelated to the model's initial intention, complicating interpretation ( see figure 3b ). as a result, quantifying featurerelevance in conjunction with visualisation can provide adequate answers for users, particularly neural network designers, to underlying questions such as how certain the model is about its decision, if and when it can be trusted, why it makes inevitable mistakes, and in which part of the learning algorithm or parametric space correction should take place. ( 3 ) in scenarios such as transfer learning, this mutual explainability approach assists designers in determining which layers should be frozen to achieve better and faster convergence, specifically when the feature map shows less divergence ( see figures 3c and 3d ). in section 4, where we introduce quantitative metrics to compare the visualisation approach with the competing ones, we will delve into greater depth on these points. experiments the proposed\n\n[Chunk 2] , whereas the other models look at different locations. this focus is known as the centre bias in saliency studies [ 7 ], [ 52 ], where most studies revealed that observers prefer to look more often at the centre of the image than at the edges. however, the xception model's tendency toward centre bias is a double - edged sword. while it is more aligned with human cognitive skills for perceiving visual data, as explained by [ 45 ], the centre of mass of the saliency map is the achilles heel of many visual explanation methods, with path attribution methods offered to address it [ 47 ] but failing the sanity checks [ 1 ]. so what should be done? although the proposed method and quantitative metrics, which are supported by best practices, can evaluate the performance of different models in visual explanation, we still have a fundamental problem with the lack of ground - truth explanations. in fact, we aim to determine which methods best explain our model without knowing how it works. evaluating supervised models is relatively straightforward since we have a test set. however, evaluating explanations is difficult since we do not exactly know how our model works and do not have the groundtruth for a fair comparison. ablation study the gradient quantifies how much a change in each input dimension affects f prediction in a narrow area around the input. keeping this in mind, our ablation study is composed of two parts : ( 1 ) we ablate the input image by randomly replacing pixels with the salt and pepper noise counterparts ; ( 2 ) we remove relu at the same time to explore the effect of negative gradients on scoring the feature map units and the visual explanation. to do this, all 3, 000 images selected from ilsvrc are ablated using the noise density of δ = [ 0. 025, 0. 05, 0. 075, 0. 1, 0. 125, 0. 15, 0. 175, 0. 2, 0. 225 ]. figure 5a depicts an ablated image, and figure 5b - 5e shows the proposed method's performance compared with other visual explanation methods. while the avx value of the advise and other visual explanation methods degrades due to incorporating negative gradients and ablating the input images, the proposed feature scoring method, unlike other methods, could meet the sensitivity axiom [ 47 ] in this classification task because the avx never reached 0. however, we should mention that the pitfall of the ablation test is that if we\n\nConstraints: Use only the context.

Visualization has proven to be well-suited in supporting this endeavor by tapping into the power of human visual perception. However, nonexperts in the field of visual data analysis often have problems with correctly reading and interpreting information from visualization idioms that are new to them. To support novices in learning how to use new digital technologies, the concept of onboarding has been successfully applied in other fields and first approaches also exist in the visualization domain. However, empirical evidence on the effectiveness of such approaches is scarce. Therefore, we conducted three studies with Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers and students investigating visualization onboarding at different levels: (1) Firstly, we explored the effect of visualization onboarding, using an interactive step-by-step guide, on user performance for four increasingly complex visualization techniques with time-oriented data: a bar chart, a horizon graph, a change matrix, and a parallel coordinates plot. We performed a between-subject experiment with 596 participants in total. The results showed that there are no significant differences between the answer correctness of the questions with and without onboarding. Particularly, participants commented that for highly familiar visualization types no onboarding is needed. However, for the most unfamiliar visualization type -the parallel coordinates plot -performance improvement can be observed with onboarding. (2) Thus, we performed a second study with MTurk workers and the parallel coordinates plot to assess if there is a difference in user performances on different visualization onboarding types: step-by-step, scrollytelling tutorial, and video tutorial. The study revealed that the video tutorial was ranked as the most positive on average, based on a sentiment analysis, followed by the scrollytelling tutorial and the interactive step-by-step guide. (3) As videos are a traditional method to support users, we decided to use the scrollytelling approach as a less prevalent way and explore it in more detail. Therefore, for our third study, we gathered data towards users' experience in using the in-situ scrollytelling for the VA tool Netflower. The results of the evaluation with students showed that they preferred scrollytelling over the tutorial integrated in the Netflower landing page. Moreover, for all three studies we explored the effect of task difficulty. In summary, the in-situ scrollytelling approach works well for integrating onboarding in a visualization tool. Additionally, a video tutorial can help to introduce interaction techniques of a visualization.", "abstract_only_llm": "The ability to derive meaningful insights from data relies heavily on the effective transformation of information into a visual format, known as visualization.

As a user, this transformation needs to be traceable to decode the visual representation and correctly reason about the data. Albeit humans are visual beings and visual representations are easier to understand than other forms of data representations, we have to learn how to read and comprehend them. Unlike reading and writing a text, we are typically not taught how to read or interpret visualizations in the course of our education-with the exception of simple business charts, like bar, line, or pie charts, which we usually encounter at a young age [2] . Hence, many users have difficulties interpreting and working with novel visual representations they are not familiar with [27, 50] . This not only bears the risk of drawing wrong conclusions but also leads to frustration or rejection of otherwise powerful data visualizations [10] . Boy et al. [11] describe visualization literacy as \"the ability to use well-established data visualizations (e.g., line graphs) to handle information in an effective, efficient, and confident manner\". Having limited visualization literacy skills can be a serious handicap as it hinders people from valuable information retrieval which could be used to learn and solve problems, or make informed decisions [24, 11, 10] .

In contrast, tutorials were often criticized for failing to address more advanced features and providing simplistic explanations. The results suggest that scrollytelling's interactive and visually-oriented approach may be more effective in motivating users and promoting engagement with the system.", "metrics": {"hwt": {"llama": {"perplexity": 11.049042250008942, "burstness": 2.837890625, "curvature": 0.07285156249999991}, "gpt2": {"perplexity": 17.14654807625046, "burstness": 2.912109375, "curvature": 0.10820312500000018}}, "only_llm": {"llama": {"perplexity": 4.390715454506516, "burstness": 1.849609375, "curvature": 0.2950683593750001}, "gpt2": {"perplexity": 10.835334427562556, "burstness": 2.171875, "curvature": 0.3146484374999998}}, "rag": {"llama": {"perplexity": 5.534147309488141, "burstness": 2.3125, "curvature": 0.3375976562499998}, "gpt2": {"perplexity": 12.520205133467638, "burstness": 2.375, "curvature": 0.3555664062499999}}}}

INTRODUCTION H UMAN perceive the world through a variety of senses, such as hearing, vision, smelling, and touching. Since the sound and vision are two dominant components, audio visual joint learning has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Audio visual event localization requires a machine to detect the event segment in an untrimmed video and recognize the category of the event. When an event occurs in both auditory and visual modes, it is regarded as an audio-visual event (as shown in Figure 1 ). Different from video action recognition [20] , which directly recognizes the category from an untrimmed video, audio-visual event localization task [1] - [12] requires the computer to divide the video into some fixed length segments, recognize the category of each segment, and combine the adjacent segments with the same category as the detection result of localization. Audio visual event localization methods are required to consider the correlation between the two modalities. Existing methods rely on visual modality to provide spatial information and pick the audio motion as the dynamic information. They also use audio modality to guide the visual modality to pay attention to the space of interesting objects. However, there are some problems in these methods: (1) Existing audio visual event localization methods focus on the visual attention guided by hearing without mining the information related to interesting events in audio modality [6] , [9] , [12] ; (2) Existing\n\nigmoid(M ), M ca ∈ R T ×da (9) a = a 1 ⊕ (M ca a 1 ) (10) In the existing methods, audio-guided visual attention is used to locate the spatial area of audible objects, only modelling the relation between audio and static vision. However, audio contains rich dynamic information, and the relationship between audio and dynamic vision needs to be fully explored. Temporal attention module in motion-guided audio attention module thar we proposed can distinguish whether a segment contains an action or not: segments with strong motion in both dynamic vision and audio are segments in which actions occur, while segments with weak visual motion are most likely to be segments presenting background noise even though the audio motion is strong. In the channel attention module, audio and dynamic visual resonance information is enhanced to reduce the influence of background noise and facilitate the classification of action categories. Then a is regarded as static visual guidance to pay attention to th\n\nse attention module, the purple bar represents the channel-wise attention module, and the corresponding module details are in the upper right corner. Under the guidance of visual motion, the event-related information of audio modality is concerned, and the background noise is filtered out. Fig. 5 . 5 Fig. 5.

The top row, middle row and bottom row show the visualization examples of CMRAN and our method respectively.As can be seen from the illustration, our PFMG network is more focused than AVEL in locating audible objects and more accurate than CMRAN.

One example are active particles, which are particles like bacteria or other microorganisms that can propel themselves. Here, simulations are used to identify how the propulsion mechanism of the particles as well as the distances between them influence the system's behavior. The analysis can result in identifying different states of matter formed by active particles. In this article, we want to investigate a so-called active crystal, which is a crystal formed by active particles. Active crystals show interesting properties and might allow for the creation of programmable materials. Each self-propelled particle is fixed in a certain 3D location but can rotate freely in all three dimensions. Considering a small crystal of k particles, where each particle is characterized by a 3-dimensional orientation vector, each state of the system (i.e., each time step of a simulation) can be described by a 3k-dimensional feature vector. Then, the task is to study the evolution of a 3k-dimensional vector over time and compare it to other ensemble members. The overall goal is to define a measure that describes the evolution of each ensemble member. This measure shall characterize the differences in temporal evolutions of the ensemble members.

The whole analysis process shown in Fig. 2 focuses on an integrated programming interface that allows for the definition of new characteristic measures based on preliminary insights into the data. A typical analytical workflow starts with a bottom-up analysis: By investigating some simulation runs in detail (T1), the user can identify characteristic behavior to define a measure that aggregates the data for each time step by inserting the definition directly into the interface (T2). This measure is then plotted over time for a selection of ensemble members and shown in a line plot (T3).

Our approach scales well to larger systems because we use dimensionality reductions by a user-defined measure. However, depending on the number of particles, the detail visualizations should be adapted to avoid overplotting. Our heatmap visualization is currently limited to analyzing two parameters that suffice for the given application scenario. However, future research directions can target the analysis of higher-dimensional parameter spaces in this context or adapt existing tools [20] .

dimensional space. however, when investigating a different run, we cannot identify such a periodic motion, neither in the line plot nor in the splom. thus, the goal is to find a measure that allows us to differentiate these types of motion. this corresponds to a so - called order parameter that would also allow to characterize the transition between the states. in a first step, we tried to use the distance to the first feature vector because this measure would become 0 every time the system repeats its behavior and thus capture its periodicity. however, by observing this measure for different runs in the timeplot, we found that it does not yield meaningful results for non - periodic cases and strongly depends on the choice of the first time step. therefore, we adapted our definition and, after some further refinement steps, we came up with a measure that uses for each timestep the closest euclidean distance to a position to which the trajectory comes back to. observing the measure in the timeplot, we found that it allows for a clear separation between different types of runs. further, it allows us to determine the end of the transition phase to a periodic motion because this measure equals 0 for periodic cases. for the aggregation over time, we chose to use the mean over the selected time. the resulting heatmap is shown in fig. 1b. here, we can clearly separate the regions with periodic behavior ( small values of d ) from other regions. we also see a continuous increase in direction of d and discontinuities in direction of beta. hovering over the heatmap reveals different distributions for the different behaviors. to obtain a better understanding, we can select a set of runs in this direction and investigate it in the", "query": "What is the main problem or motivation addressed in this paper?"}, {"vector_id": 1542, "score": 0.5301545262336731, "text": "the energy for self -

dimensional space. however, when investigating a different run, we cannot identify such a periodic motion, neither in the line plot nor in the splom. thus, the goal is to find a measure that allows us to differentiate these types of motion. this corresponds to a so - called order parameter that would also allow to characterize the transition between the states. in a first step, we tried to use the distance to the first feature vector because this measure would become 0 every time the system repeats its behavior and thus capture its periodicity. however, by observing this measure for different runs in the timeplot, we found that it does not yield meaningful results for non - periodic cases and strongly depends on the choice of the first time step. therefore, we adapted our definition and, after some further refinement steps, we came up with a measure that uses for each timestep the closest euclidean distance to a position to which the trajectory comes back to. observing the measure in the timeplot, we found that it allows for a clear separation between different types of runs. further, it allows us to determine the end of the transition phase to a periodic motion because this measure equals 0 for periodic cases. for the aggregation over time, we chose to use the mean over the selected time. the resulting heatmap is shown in fig. 1b. here, we can clearly separate the regions with periodic behavior ( small values of d ) from other regions. we also see a continuous increase in direction of d and discontinuities in direction of beta. hovering over the heatmap reveals different distributions for the different behaviors. to obtain a better understanding, we can select a set of runs in this direction and investigate it in the\n\n[Chunk 2] the energy for self -

propulsion on the surrounding fluid. thus, the propulsion mechanism and the distance between the particles determine the interaction and, therefore, the system's characteristic behavior. numerical simulations are a helpful tool to understand and explore new interesting behavior. the state of the system at one point in time can be described by a multi - dimensional vector. in our case study, we observe seven particles whose orientation is defined by a 3d vector. combining these vectors creates a 21 - dimensional feature vector containing the complete information about the system's state. the simulations take two input parameters, where one defines the distance between the individual particles ( d ) and the other defines the propulsion mechanism ( beta ). considering the variations over time and the simulation's input parameters, we can characterize the data as an ensemble of multi - dimensional trajectories. a common way in physics to analyze such ensemble data is to use a set of python scripts or jupyter notebooks. however, both cases lead to the creation of static plots. exploring the dataset to find interesting properties and understanding the system's behavior needs many recreations of these graphs, which interrupts the workflow. this is especially true if the analysis includes finding new measures for characterizing and aggregating the data. based on our experience within the project described in [ 10 ], we defined the following set of requirements for an analysis of the simulation ensemble : ( r1 ) to understand the underlying data and how they can be summarized in an expressive way, the multi -

However, most works focus on synthesizing visual outputs, ignoring other sensory outputs such as touch. In real life, humans use vision and touch to explore objects. When shopping for clothing, we look at them to perceive their shape and appearance and touch them to anticipate the experience of wearing them. A single touch can reveal the material's roughness, hardness, and local geometry. Multi-modal perceptual inputs enable humans to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the target objects, enhancing user experiences, such as online shopping and quick prototyping. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for content creation, such as touchable VR and movies. In this work, we aim to expand the capability of content creation. We introduce a new problem setting, controllable visual-tactile synthesis, for synthesizing high-resolution images and haptic feedback outputs from user inputs of a sketch or text. Our goal is to provide a more immersive experience for humans when exploring objects in a virtual environment. Visual-tactile synthesis is challenging for two reasons. First, existing generative models struggle to model visual and tactile outputs jointly du\n\ne our method on the similarity between the synthesized output and the real data of the TouchClothing dataset. For both visual and tactile output, we report the LPIPS metric [91] for perceptual realism as prior works [91, 30] have shown that the LPIPS metric better matches human perception, compared to PSNR and SSIM [79] . We also use Single Image Fréchet Inception Distance (SIFID) [66] for texture similarity, as extensively used in prior works [66, 53] . Since the dataset only contains one visual image per object, we evaluate LPIPS on seen sketches for visual reconstruction and SIFID on unseen sketches for texture consistency in generalization. In addition to automatic metrics, we perform a human preference study. Baselines. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to study visual-tactile synthesis conditioned on a sketch input.

However, the design nature of these end-to-end models prevents them from being interpretable to humans, undermining trust and applicability in critical domains. While post-hoc rationales offer certain insight into understanding model behavior, these explanations are not guaranteed to be faithful to the model. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by introducing an interpretable by design model that factors model decisions into intermediate humanlegible explanations, and allows people to easily understand why a model fails or succeeds. We propose the Dynamic Clue Bottleneck Model (DCLUB ), a method that is designed one step towards an inherently interpretable VQA system. DCLUB provides an explainable intermediate space before the VQA decision and is faithful from the beginning, while maintaining comparable performance to black-box systems. Given a question and an image, DCLUB first returns a set of visual clues: natural language statements of visually salient evidence from the image, and then generates the output based solely on the visual clues. To supervise and evaluate the generation of VQA explanations within DCLUB, we collect a dataset of 1.7k questions with visual clues. Evaluations show that our inherently interpretable system can improve 4.64% over a comparable black-box system in reasoning focused questions while preserving 99.43% of performance on VQA-v2.", "abstract_only_llm": "Visual Question Answering (VQA) models have made significant strides in recent years, achieving high accuracy on benchmark datasets. However, the blackbox nature of these models often hinders our ability to understand the reasoning behind their decisions. In this work, we propose a novel approach, DCLUB (Decision through Clue-Based Understanding), that aims to bridge this gap by providing visual clues that hint at the answer. Unlike traditional VQA methods that directly generate answers, DCLUB first identifies relevant visual features in the image and then decides the answer based solely on these clues.\nOur proposed method, illustrated in Figure 1, adopts a two-stage architecture that enables the model to reason about the visual input in a more interpretable manner. By providing visual clues, DCLUB enables users to understand the decision-making process of the model, thereby enhancing visual understanding in VQA. This work contributes to the development of more transparent and explainable AI models, with potential applications in various fields where visual understanding is crucial, such as robotics, healthcare, and education.", "abstract_rag": "This research explores the development of a novel framework, DClub, that leverages large language models for interpretable visual reasoning. Building upon existing models, DClub introduces an explicit visual clue generation component, which produces a set of relevant visual features from an image. These visual clues are then used in conjunction with natural language entailment scores to generate accurate and interpretable answers to complex visual questions.\nThe proposed framework is designed to improve the transparency and explainability of visual question answering models. By generating explicit visual clues, DClub enables users to understand the reasoning process behind the model's predictions, thereby promoting trust and reliability in AI-driven decision-making.\nThe framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparisons with existing blackbox models, showcasing improved performance and coverage in visual question answering tasks. However, the research also acknowledges the potential environmental implications of relying on large language models and emphasizes the need for responsible and sustainable AI development practices.

Recent studies indicate that post-hoc rationales by blackbox models seems plausible and might potentially reveal certain insight into their predictions, increasing trust in such models (Selvaraju et al., 2016 ; Park 1 arXiv:2305.14882v2 [cs.CL] 13 Apr 2024 Question: Is the airplane landing or taking off?

We turn the sub-questions and sub-answers into statements, and serve as low-quality visual clues for the original data. We fine-tune our visual clue generation model following a two-stage training strategy: first on the large weak supervision set, then on DCLUB. We report the end task performance calculated following the standard VQA evaluation metric in Antol et al. (2015) , and show the performance comparisons between our interpretable vqa model and their blackbox counterparts. In Table 2 , we demonstrate that DCLUB achieves a comparable result with its blackbox counterpart on both of VQA v2 and GQA: covering 99.43% and 95.24% of the blackbox model performances corresponding, and even reaches a higher accuracy score on our collected testing set, achieving 104.64% of the blackbox model performance.

However, the blackbox nature of these models often hinders our ability to understand the reasoning behind their decisions. In this work, we propose a novel approach, DCLUB (Decision through Clue-Based Understanding), that aims to bridge this gap by providing visual clues that hint at the answer. Unlike traditional VQA methods that directly generate answers, DCLUB first identifies relevant visual features in the image and then decides the answer based solely on these clues.\nOur proposed method, illustrated in Figure 1, adopts a two-stage architecture that enables the model to reason about the visual input in a more interpretable manner. By providing visual clues, DCLUB enables users to understand the decision-making process of the model, thereby enhancing visual understanding in VQA.

The visual crop may or may not consist of objects that have been previously observed during training, which makes the challenge similar to a zero-shot or few-shot detection problem. The baseline [8] provides a solution for this challenge by using a Region Proposal Network (RPN) on each frame to propose possible locations of objects. These proposals are then passed through a Siamese Head [11] to obtain a score that represents their similarity with the visual crop. The proposed region with the highest similarity is considered to be the location of the object in the frame. This highest similarity score for the object in each frame of the video is then used to create a similarity score signal as a function of time. Local maxima points are identified on this signal, and the object in the most recent local maxima is tracked in both forward and reverse directions to provide a response track of its final occurrence. However, a limitation of this approach has been previously identified as the presence of false positives that come as a result of the high similarity of the proposals with the visual crop [13] . This can be due to reasons such as an occluded visual query object, distribution gap between training and evaluation, ambiguous query objects, or other factors such as the background having higher similarity with the object in the proposal box. While the pre\n\ne our prior act as a conjugate prior, we need to select Bernoulli as the distribution of our measurements. However, Bern(n, k) is a discrete distribution whilst the Siamese head outputs similarity scores which are continuously defined between 0 and 1. Furthermore, n being the number of trials and k being the number of successes for those trials would not make sense in our application since we only pass each bounding box through the Siamese head once, and passing it multiple times would not introduce randomization in the result. To resolve the aforementioned challenges, we introduce a way to map our continuous result to this discrete representation by treating our similarity score as a percentage success. As an example, we can treat a similarity score of 0.9 as having success in 9 out of 10 trials, as well as 90 successes out of 100 trials. To determine the number of trials, we introduce a new hyperparameter w which will determine our confidence in the measurement. The similarity score \n\nsample of it. The performance of our approach on the test set can also be attributed to the lack of these optimized hyperparameters. We have observed that giving a very high weightage to the prior belief (the similarity from BEiT) can cause hallucinations, where for example if the visual query has a metallic object, the pipeline would show high similarity with any random object that has a metallic attribute. On the contrary, giving higher weightage to the Siamese Head brings back the False Positives that occurred due to a lack of contextual information and other previously mentioned reasons. Finally, it is also worth noting that our approach achieves a significantly lower stAP for a given tAP as compared to the baseline. We expect this to be caused by the proposed bounding box not perfectly surrounding the object in the frame where the most recent local maximum was found, resulting in the accumulation of errors during tracking. The proposed solution for this is a possible modification of the RPN or a run with better hyper-parameters that ensure better matching. Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1. The updated model architecture.

parameters, and restricts only being able to use a smaller sample of it. the performance of our approach on the test set can also be attributed to the lack of these optimized hyperparameters. we have observed that giving a very high weightage to the prior belief ( the similarity from beit ) can cause hallucinations, where for example if the visual query has a metallic object, the pipeline would show high similarity with any random object that has a metallic attribute. on the contrary, giving higher weightage to the siamese head brings back the false positives that occurred due to a lack of contextual information and other previously mentioned reasons. finally, it is also worth\n\n[Chunk 2] ) can cause hallucinations, where for example if the visual query has a metallic object, the pipeline would show high similarity with any random object that has a metallic attribute. on the contrary, giving higher weightage to the siamese head brings back the false positives that occurred due to a lack of contextual information and other previously mentioned reasons. finally, it is also worth noting that our approach achieves a significantly lower stap for a given tap as compared to the baseline. we expect this to be caused by the proposed bounding box not perfectly surrounding the object in the frame where the most recent local maximum was found, resulting in the accumulation of errors during tracking. the proposed solution for this is a possible modification of the rpn or a run with better hyper -

For example, a university that is not on the top-k list can be deemed as less prestigious; a product that is not recommended to buyers can lose substantial amounts in revenue; a job candidate who does not feature among the top applicants would not objectively know how to improve their chances relative to an applicant pool. From the perspective of stakeholders, like, data subjects who are ranked (henceforth, termed as rankees) or decision-makers, it is often a guessing game for them to interpret the logic behind the ranking information that matters to them. Such inaccessibility and lack of transparency are ultimately detrimental to creating equitable socio-technical systems [1] where proprietary ranking schemes could be questionable yet, hold disproportionate power over stakeholders. Our work addresses this problem by conceptualizing an analytical workflow (Figure 1 ) that combines machine-learning explanations with expressive visualizations for making ranking schemes interpretable and actionable to different stakeholders. We learn a model by using the approach of supervised learning: training learning-to-rank (LTR) a\n\ntal models about the ranked items. Users may evaluate the models based on the outputs and the attribute importance associated with the local groupings in the subset created through the data filters. The data filters consist of: Range selection: In the default selection, where users may like to compare across different models, they can use the range selection filter to select a specific rank range of interest. For example, users can select rankees TRIVEA in the rank range of 30 to 60 (Figure 3b ). Attribute selection: Users can use the attribute selection filter (Figure 3d ) to select the items by their attribute values. For example, an analyst can select universities with a female student ratio above forty percent.

ranked university that does not suit their priorities. for this scenario, we use the university data set [ 29 ] introduced earlier in section 5. an applicant first examined the rankers in the range of 1 to 100 in the default ranker mode. using mean average precision and manually checking the rank deviations, he concluded that the ranking svm model performed the best. then the applicant used the range comparison mode in trivea and chose the range 1 -

For tasks in which data annotation is pricey or even impossible to acquire, a round of selfsupervised pre-training prior to learning the downstream task of interest can significantly enhance the system's final performance and reduce costs with data annotation. In computer vision, one main advantage of SSL [10, 17, 18, 23] over generative models [16, 24, 29] , is the avoidance of reconstructing the input signal. Typically, generative models optimize a cost function in the pixel space, seeking to reconstruct the original input with high fidelity. Besides the high computing costs of operating in the pixel space, these methods assume that every pixel in the image matters equally. However, from the representation learning To appear in the 4th Visual Inductive Priors for Data-Efficient Deep Learning Workshop at ICCV 2023 perspective, this property may not be necessary. Instead, the SSL approach of working at the embedding level allows SSL methods to learn representations that discard useless information. This strategy can be precious for learning downstream tasks since much of the details of an image may be useless for solving many downstream tasks. For instance, if the task of interest only requires a global signal, such as the class information, given a fixed-size feature vector, the encoder may be encouraged to discard lowlevel details, such as position, background, and orientation, i\n\nge of this matching algorithm is that we do not need to force views to share an intersected region. Local representations from different views that do not intersect can still be paired if they are close enough in the pixel space. Moreover, the choice of T pos matters since it controls the average number target local representations. Intuitively, if T pos is too high, a pixel I 1 i might consider all pixels in I 2 as neighbors. As a result, it invalidates the spatial locality inductive bias present in natural images. On the other hand, if T pos is too low, it limits the target space as the spatial locality bias is not explored to its fullest, as described in Section 5.3. Predicting local embeddings with contextualized vectors At this point, we could match local features across different views on an image using the feature indices in M .

By leveraging SSL, we can tap into the vast amounts of unlabelled visual data, reducing the reliance on expensive and time-consuming manual annotation. This approach has far-reaching implications for various downstream tasks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation.\nThe primary goal of SSL is to develop a robust visual understanding of the data, which can be transferred to downstream tasks. By pre-training a model on a large corpus of unlabelled data, we can learn to recognize patterns, relationships, and contextual dependencies. This knowledge can then be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks, leading to improved performance and reduced annotation costs.\nOur investigation explores the potential of SSL in enhancing visual understanding and its subsequent impact on downstream tasks. We examine the theoretical foundations and practical applications of SSL, highlighting its potential to revolutionize the field of computer vision.

communities, and their connections. descriptive captions and concise summaries of this information can be generated and presented alongside the visualization, which greatly facilitates visualization comprehension. a critical challenge in adapting current foundation models to understand complex visualizations is the lack of domain - specific data. currently, existing public datasets in the visualization field often focus on simple charts like bar charts or line charts [ 14 ]. thus, it is critical to create a public dataset containing complex visualizations and their extracted insights. another challenge lies in identifying contextually relevant information that matches the analytical focus. interactive visualizations often excel at conveying useful patterns embedded in a large amount of data. for example, a visualization of a social network may present multiple interesting sub - communities that deserve exploration. a tailored summary of sub - communities of interest is often more beneficial than a generic overview of the entire network. consequently, the task of capturing users'analytical focus and dynamically extracting relevant patterns and tailored summaries for visualizations emerges as a promising avenue for future investigation. visual -

[ 27 ] developed deepnlpvis to identify and diagnose performance issues in deep natural language processing models. deepnlpvis introduces an information - based sample interpretation method to extract the intra - word and inter - word information. the corpus - level, sentence - level, and word - level visualizations are tightly integrated to visually explain model behavior. with a comprehensive understanding of how the model processes inputs, model developers can identify and address performance issues efficiently. sliceteller [ 28 ] allows model developers to diagnose model performance on different subsets of validation data. it first automatically constructs several subsets of data with potential performance issues and presents them for performance diagnosis. after model developers identify critical subsets for further optimization, sliceteller estimates the performance changes across different subsets. this enables developers to compare the trade - offs and decide whether to accept the optimization. efficiency diagnosis. in contrast to performance diagnosis, efficiency diagnosis focuses on identifying efficiency bottlenecks that slow down the training speed or consume unnecessary resources during the training process. as foundation models continue to grow in scale, the importance of the efficiency diagnosis becomes even more critical. a widely used strategy to accelerate the training of a foundation model is to parallelize the process in a distributed cluster. despite its effectiveness, it is challenging to diagnose the parallel training process due to the intricate nature of parallelization strategies and the large volume of profiling data, such as execution time, resource utilization, and communication overhead. to tackle these issues, wei et al.

Studies in neuroscience and cognitive science suggest that the key to this ability is the process of acquiring abstract, conceptual, and reusable pieces of knowledge from past experiences and applying them in new configurations to comprehend a novel situation [30, 15, 76, 7] . For instance, a person who understands the implications of a scene involving a \"big dog\" and a \"small cat\", e.g., how they may interact and what the subsequent scene may look like, can also reasonably understand the implications of an unfamiliar scenario involving a \"big cat\" and a \"small dog\". While this capability, termed systematic compositionality, is fundamental to human intelligence, how neural networks can acquire such an ability remains one of the grand challenges in machine learning [63, 6, 36] . The notion of systematic compositionality originates from the fields of philosophy of language and linguistics [95, 30] . Language inherently provides a compositional representation using token structures, such as words or characters, which simplifies addressing compositional systematicity.

shot manner by envisioning the possible future [ 79, 7 ]. studies in neuroscience and cognitive science suggest that the key to this ability is the process of acquiring abstract, conceptual, and reusable pieces of knowledge from past experiences and applying them in new configurations to comprehend a novel situation [ 30, 15, 76, 7 ]. for instance, a person who understands the implications of a scene involving a \" big dog \" and a \" small cat \", e. g., how they may interact and what the subsequent scene may look like, can also reasonably understand the implications of an unfamiliar scenario involving a \" big cat \" and a \" small dog \". while this capability, termed systematic compositionality, is fundamental to human intelligence, how neural networks can acquire such an ability remains one of the grand challenges in machine learning [ 63, 6, 36 ]. the notion of systematic compositionality originates from the fields of philosophy of language and linguistics [ 95, 30 ]. language inherently provides a compositional representation using token structures, such as words or characters, which simplifies addressing compositional systematicity. as a result, the ai community has also made efforts to address this problem predominantly in the language domain [ 22, 63, 59, 88, 67, 2, 57, 28, 87, 106 ]. one notable milestone driving progress in this field recently is the development of the scan benchmark [ 63 ] posing a sequence -

the dataset was created as a test - bed to evaluate the systematic generalization ability of visual imagination models, with an emphasis on compositionality at the level of intra - object factors ( e. g., color, shape, size, etc. ) and visual complexity. question 2 : who created the dataset ( e. g., which team or research group ) and on behalf of which entity ( e. g., company, institution, organization )? the dataset was created by the authors who are affiliated with machine learning and mind lab ( mlml ) situated in the school of computing at korea advanced institute of science and technology ( kaist ) and rutgers university. a. 2 composition question 1 : what do the instances that comprise the dataset represent ( e. g., documents, photos, people, countries )? the dataset comprises several tasks. within each task, we provide 1 ) several training splits of different difficulties of systematic generalization, and 2 ) a test split. within each split, we provide several pairs of images, with the first image in each\n\n[Chunk 2] the difficulty of systematic generalization becomes less severe and we see a consistent downward slope in the error plots across baselines and tasks. this is also supported by the qualitative results in fig. 5, where, with increasing α, a greater number of baselines are able to improve their predictions. since training splits with larger α expose more combinations, there is more opportunity for the baselines to overcome learning spurious correlations and discover the compositional primitives and the causal rule to apply. performance at α = 0. 6. our easiest training split corresponds to α = 0. 6 which exposes the largest fraction of combinations during training. yet, on most tasks, most baselines are not able to reach the performance of oracle - although it does happen in some select cases. from this, we can say that our benchmark is largely unsolved with significant room for progress. performance of oracle. we note that oracle is the best performer as it is the only baseline that can solve the tasks as early as at α = 0. downward slope. this can be explained by considering that svib requires systematic perception i. e., learning to perceive the input in terms of useful tokens - explicitly or implicitly - while also generalizing systematically to ood inputs. oracle is designed with access to the ground - truth tokens directly and it does not need to learn systematic perception via training. on the contrary, other baselines carry the additional burden of learning systematic perception along with rule learningcontributing to their worse performance. performance on svib - clevrtex. the performance of baselines on svib - clevrtex requires a special mention as we see that the curves with respect to α are almost flat and the slope is not as such, we can attribute the degraded performance of other baselines in svib - clevrtex to their poor systematic perception. this shows that higher visual complexity can make systematic perception more difficult in comparison to visually simple scenes of svib - dsprites and svib - clevr. this observation is also supported by the predictions visualized in fig. 14. it is noteworthy that our proposed benchmark provides a unique opportunity to study systematic imagination in visually complex scenes as the existing image - to - image benchmarks provide visually toy - like scenes [ 19, 4 ]. comparison of baselines we now compare the baselines in more detail. we draw our conclusions based on tasks with ratings of α = 0. 2 and 0. 4 since the tasks are too difficult for α\n\nConstraints: Use only the context.

The results indicate that the difficulty of systematic generalization decreases as the training splits expose more combinations, allowing models to learn compositional primitives and causal rules. However, even with increased exposure, most models struggle to reach the performance of the oracle model.\nThe benchmark highlights the importance of systematic perception and visual complexity in visual understanding, and provides a unique opportunity to study systematic imagination in visually complex scenes.

Both challenges lead to issues such as poor generalizability, hallucination, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we construct VISION-FLAN, the most diverse publicly available visual instruction tuning dataset to date, comprising 187 diverse tasks and 1,664,261 instances sourced from academic datasets, and each task is accompanied by an expert-written instruction. In addition, we propose a two-stage instruction tuning framework, in which VLMs are firstly finetuned on VISION-FLAN and further tuned on GPT-4 synthesized data. We find this two-stage tuning framework significantly outperforms the traditional single-stage visual instruction tuning framework and achieves the state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of multi-modal evaluation benchmarks. Finally, we conduct indepth analyses to understand visual instruction tuning and our findings reveal that: (1) GPT-4 synthesized data does not substantially enhance VLMs' capabilities but rather modulates the model's responses to human-preferred formats; (2) A minimal quantity (e.g., 1,000) of GPT-4 synthesized data can effectively align VLM responses with human-preference; (3) Visual instruction tuning mainly helps large-language models (LLMs) to understand visual features.", "abstract_only_llm": "Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled them to serve as general visual assistants, exhibiting impressive capabilities in understanding and generating detailed responses to visual instructions.

Firstly, the data used in the pre-training stage is dominated by the image captioning task, which lacks diversity, resulting in limited generalizability of VLMs (Chen et al., 2023c; Zhang et al., 2023) . For instance, the LLaVA model (Liu et al., 2023e) performs poorly on the optical character recognition (OCR) task due to the absence of instances related to text detection during pre-training (Zhang et al., 2023) . Several recent studies address this problem by further fin\n\nr the style and format of outputs from LLMs, and does not substantially change the parameter space of LLMs. Following this finding, we hypothesize that the MLP layers that map visual features into LLMs' embedding space can be shared across LLMs with identical architecture but are tuned on different text alignment datasets.

Conventional methods for higher-order movement modeling first construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of movements, then extract higher-order patterns from the DAG. However, DAG-based methods heavily rely on the identification of movement keypoints that are challenging for sparse movements and fail to consider the temporal variants that are critical for movements in urban environments. To overcome the limitations, we propose HoLens, a novel approach for modeling and visualizing higher-order movement patterns in the context of an urban environment. HoLens mainly makes twofold contributions: first, we design an auto-adaptive movement aggregation algorithm that selforganizes movements hierarchically by considering spatial proximity, contextual information, and temporal variability; second, we develop an interactive visual analytics interface consisting of well-established visualization techniques, including the H-Flow for visualizing the higher-order patterns on the map and the higher-order state sequence chart for representing the higher-order state transitions. Two real-world case studies manifest that the method can adaptively aggregate the data and exhibit the process of how to explore the higher-order patterns by HoLens.

Each entity is represented as a node of the network, and flows are encoded as edges. Such a network model implicitly assumes that the current status is dependent on only its precedent, i.e., first-order dependency as in a Markov process [3] , Fig. 1(B) . However, the model cannot represent scenarios where the current status may not entirely depend on its first-order precedent. For example, when humans browse the Internet, subsequent mouse-clicking behavior may not depend on only one previous behavior [4] . Higher-order dependency analysis, which can be traced back to Shannon's high-order memory model [5] , can alleviate the problem. The analysis is crucial to many real-world applications e.g., the analysis of animal behavior [6] , rumor spread [7] . For example, biologists gathered the data from sensors mounted on animals and extracted higher-order dependencies to analyze behavior patterns and activities [6, 8] . By tracing multiple higher-order pathways in global ship data, species invasions are investigated and predicted [1] . When analyzing geospatial movements, higher-order patterns that reveal sequential multi-step state transitions may depict insights different from origin-destination (OD) patterns. For\n\ngions in one pattern. State Transition View The state transition view Fig. 3 (D) aims to show the details of the higher-order patterns (R.4) and support comparison between different higher-order patterns (R.5). In this view, we design a higher-order state sequence chart (Fig. 5 ) that can not only represent the higher-order state but also reveal the flows' change between two states. The higher-order state sequence chart is composed of nodes and edges. The node is a circular glyph (Fig. 5(A 1 )), and each node represents one region. The sector of the circular glyph is the distribution of the flow for each category of POI. The edge (Fig. 5(A 1 )) between two adjacent nodes represents the flow between two regions. In comparison with the conventional Sankey diagram [40] , we first use a rectangle (Fig. 5(A 1 )) located at the center between two adjacent nodes instead of the edge of the Sankey diagram to represent the flow. The width of the rectangle indicates the overall flow between two a\n\ns (B) The alternative design of the H 9 Fig. 10 910 Fig. 10 Parameter selection: (A) to (D) are the aggregating range β with different range with the aggregating threshold α = 1.9; (E) to (H) are the aggregating range β with different range with the aggregating threshold α = 2.2; (I) to (L) are the aggregating range β with different range with the aggregating threshold α = 2.5.

[ 18 ] proposed a glyph that bridges the two consecutive nodes directly by the current node. in theory, this method can integrate different dependencies through the current node to build the correspondence, but the area of the current node limits the scalability of various dependencies. to handle such issues, honvis [ 1 ] visualizes the higher - order dependencies and supports the exploration from an overview to a finegrained level while ignoring the temporal characteristics of the higher - order dependency. holens aims to intuitively represent the higher - order dependencies, especially revealing the temporal features that can further help experts analyze the movement pattern. requirement and method overview in this section, we summarize the requirements ( sect. 3. 1 ) and provide an overview ( sect. 3. 2 ) of our solution. requirement analysis in the early stage of this research, we held regular meetings with the target users and two domain experts ( e. a and e. b ). the target users are focused on emergency response for traffic management and urban planning. they aim to find the law of human movement and determine what people tend to do ( what happened ) in a certain region at a certain time. their daily work, which involves analyzing higher - order movement patterns, has two goals, including 1 ) segmenting the urban area into functional regions and 2 ) optimizing the traffic. we summarize the requirements for this research from two aspects : higher - order movement modeling ( r. 1, r. 2, r. 3 ) and higher - order pattern visualization ( r. 4, r. 5 ). r. 1 context - aware aggregation. to avoid sparsity of the movement data in an urban area, aggregating the data into clusters and constructing"}]}, "rag_prompt": "You are writing an academic abstract using the provided context.\nKeyword: visual_understanding\n\nContext:\n[Chunk 1] 3 - 9 is not the best one, which just seems reasonable in our case studies. an algorithm that can adaptively control the aggregation range according to the size of the aggregation region is necessary for the future, but it is not involved in this work. order number determination in this research, the \" higher - order \" is a multi - step propagation. however, the number of the order is a complicated problem that needs long pathways to distinguish the real effects due to the lack of data [ 4 ]. previous studies have had many different viewpoints e. g., rosvall et al.

Motivated by this progress, researchers have pioneered the development of powerful large visionlanguage models (LVLMs) [3] , [4] , [5] , leveraging the impressive capabilities of LLMs to enhance comprehension of visual semantics. This advance particularly improves model performance in complex vision-language tasks [4] , [6] , [7] , and represents a major step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). AGI refers to intelligent systems that are capable of solving any task that can be performed by humans or animals. Generally, tasks performed by humans can be divided into general and specialized tasks according to whether special domain knowledge is required. Therefore, the capabilities of LVLMs can be categorized into these two aspects accordingly, and both of them are essential for LVLMs on the path toward AGI. Recently, numerous studies have assessed and investigated the general and specialized capabilities of LVLMs [6] , [7] , [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] . Qin et al.

However, they make errors when asked to locate the target types directly, as shown in Fig. 3 . This failure indicates that they exhibit decreased robustness or are unskilled when faced with more complex and abstracted problems. That is, they need to understand the notion of complex concept of \"salient\". It is worth noting that LVLMs achieve lower performance on camouflaged objects, which could be attributed to the resemblance of camouflaged objects to their surroundings. Such failures also demonstrate the challenge faced by LVLMs in accurately categorizing these objects, as mentioned in § 2.2. Limited cognition toward medical images and anoma-lies.

occurrence patterns [ 45 ] to address the issues. apart from the hallucination, these models encounter additional challenges, including decreased robustness when confronted with complex problems and reduced effectiveness in numerous general tasks, underscoring the fact that the comprehensive capabilities of current lvlms remain limited. future research is anticipated to leverage increasingly challenging datasets / problems while also providing detailed and specific procedures in instruction tuning [ 9 ], [ 46 ] to enhance the comprehensive capabilities of lvlms. besides, adopting advanced techniques such as feedback / reward mechanisms [ 47 ], [ 48 ] and integrating expert models [ 49 ] are also viable avenues to enhance their capabilities. incorporating additional visual information. current lvlms exhibit a significant limitation in leveraging visual information, as they are restricted to utilizing a single image, typically an rgb image, for each task [ 50 ]. it is widely recognized that for certain visual tasks, such as object detection and recognition in complex scenes ( e. g., those with heavy background clutter ), relying solely on a single modality of visual information poses significant challenges [ 17 ], [ 51 ]. therefore, the visual perceptual capabilities of lvlms will be greatly limited when applied to these tasks. to address this issue, a potential avenue for the future development of lvlms is to integrate complementary visual information, such as depth [ 52 ], [ 53 ], [ 54 ], [ 55 ], [ 56 ] and focus cues [ 51 ] to augment their perceptual capabilities, the effectiveness of which has been extensively validated in the domain of computer vision. other potential applications of lvlms. despite the existing room for improvement, lvlms have exhibited remarkable proficiency in tasks such as image summarization / description and visual question answering. their superior proficiency in these fundamental tasks holds promise for their application\n\nConstraints: Use only the context.

Transformer-based methods face challenges in time series prediction tasks related to human movements and music due to their struggle in capturing the nonlinear relationship and temporal aspects. This can lead to issues like joint deformation, role deviation, floating, and inconsistencies in dance movements generated in response to the music. In this paper, we propose a Quaternion-Enhanced Attention Network (QEAN) for visual dance synthesis from a quaternion perspective, which consists of a Spin Position Embedding (SPE) module and a Quaternion Rotary Attention (QRA) module. First, SPE embeds position information into self-attention in a rotational manner, leading to better learning of features of movement sequences and audio sequences, and improved understanding of the connection between music and dance. Second, QRA represents and fuses 3D motion features and audio features in the form of a series of quaternions, enabling the model to better learn the temporal coordination of music and dance under the complex temporal cycle conditions of dance generation.

We compare the effectiveness of our method is compared with other approaches in generating dance movements from seed motions. In the top row labeled \"other methods\", two sets of images showcase the transformation of seed movements into unnatural final poses characterized by joint deformation and character drift. Conversely, in the bottom row labeled \"our method\", we demonstrate how the application of Pre-quaternion parameterization (P), Spin Position Embedding (S), and Quaternion Attention (Q) yields natural-looking final poses. Each prediction produced by our method successfully learns the correlations between dance and music. Dancing is a universal language across all cultures [1, 2] and is used by many as a powerful means of self-expression on online media platforms, becoming a dynamic tool for disseminating information on the Internet. Although dance is an art form, it requires professional practice and training to give dancers a rich expressive voice [3] . Therefore, from a computational point of view, music-conditioned 3D dance generation [4, 5, 6, 7] has become a critical task that promises to open up a variety of practical applications. However, creating satisfying dance sequences that harmonize with specific music and body structures faces challenges because of our lack of understanding of the timing of human movements and the connection between music a\n\ngeneralisation ability. Motivated by the work of Jianlin Su [40] , who proposed the Rotary Position Embedding, a positional embedding method designed to enhance the performance of the Transformer architecture by integrating relative positional information into selfattention. The popular LLama2 [10] model currently employs this position embedding approach.Therefore, we borrowed from Su and embedded the extracted audio and motion features into self-attention in the form of rotated positions to better learn the features in it and improve the computational efficiency. The basic idea can be seen in Fig. 3 . First, we define a sequence of features of length N (since motion and audio features operate similarly in the process of SPE,The O in the next equation represents different operations for different eigenvectors in different situations): F N = {W i } N i=1 . Where w i represents the i-th token in the input sequence, and the embedding corresponding to the input sequence F N is denoted as E\n\ns.

regressive manner at 60 fps, with only the first predicted motion retained at each step. for music feature extraction, we employ the publicly available audio processing toolbox, librosa [ 42 ], which includes 1 - dimensional envelope, 20 - dimensional mfcc, 12 - dimensional chroma, 1 - dimensional one - hot peaks, and 1 - dimensional one - hot beats, resulting in a 35 - dimensional music feature. the motion features combine a 9 - dimensional representation of rotation matrices for all 24 joints with a 3 - dimensional global translation vector, resulting in a 219 - dimensional motion feature. these raw audio and motion features are initially embedded into 800 - dimensional hidden representations using linear layers, with learnable position embeddings added"}]}, "rag_prompt": "You are writing an academic abstract using the provided context.\nKeyword: visual_understanding\n\nContext:\n[Chunk 1] music and more diversified. motion quality motion diversity motion -

th token with positional information t integrated into the feature vector x t. then, we need to compute the output of self - attention for the s - th feature embedding vector x s. this involves calculating an attention score between q s and other k t, and then multiplying the attention score by the corresponding v t, followed by summation to obtain the output vector o s : a s, t = exp ( q t s kt √ d ) n j = 1 exp ( qskj √ d ) ( 9 ) o s = n n = 1 a s, t v n ( 10 ) next, in order to leverage the relative positional relationships between the mentioned tokens, let's assume that the dot product operation between the query vector q s and the key vector k t is represented by a function g. the input to function g includes the word embedding vectors x s, x t and their relative position s - t : < o q ( x s, s ), o k ( x t, t ) > = g ( x s, x t, s - t ) ( 11 ) we then discover an alternative approach to position embedding that upholds the aforementioned relationship. o q ( x s, s ) = ( w q x s ) e isθ ( 12 ) o k ( x t, t ) = ( w k x t ) e itθ ( 13 ) o ( x s, x t, s -

truth motion. to capture motion features, we utilize two meticulously crafted motion feature extractors, as undisclosed motion encoders were employed in earlier works [ 44 ]. these extractors include : ( 1 ) a geometric feature extractor, generating a boolean vector that represents geometric relationships among specific body points in the motion sequence, and ( 2 ) a dynamic feature extractor, mapping the motion sequence to capture dynamic aspects such as velocity and acceleration. we designate fid based on these geometric and dynamic features as f id g and f id d, respectively. the metrics are computed by comparing real dance motion sequences in the aist + + test set with 40 generated motion sequences, each comprising t = 1200 frames ( 20 seconds ). as depicted in table 1, our generated motion sequences exhibit distributions that are closer to ground - truth motion compared to the three methods. generation diversity : we also assess the model's capacity to generate diverse dance movements in response to different input music, comparing its performance to baseline methods. following a methodology similar to previous research [ 45 ], we compute the average euclidean distance in the feature space of 40 generated motions from the aist + + test set to quantify diversity. the motion diversity in geometric and dynamic feature spaces is denoted as dist g and dist k, respectively. table1 illustrates that our method excels in generating more diverse dance movements in comparison to the baselines, with the exception of li [ 29 ]. the latter discretizes motions, resulting in discontinuous outputs and elevated dist k. motion - music correlation : moreover, we gauge the correlation between the generated 3d motion and input music by introducing a novel metric known as the beat alignment score. this metric evaluates the motion - music correlation by measuring the similarity between the beats in the motion and music. librosa [ 42 ] is employed to extract music beats, while motion beats are computed as local minima in the motion velocity. the beat alignment score is articulated as the average distance between each motion beat and its nearest music beat. to be specific, our beat alignment score is defined as : beatalign = 1 z z i = 1 exp ( - d j ∈ b d | | t c i - t d j | | 2 2α 2 ) ( 29 ) where b c = { t c i } is the set of motion beats, b d = t d j is the music beats, and α is a parameter for normalizing sequences with different fps.\n\nConstraints: Use only the context.

This investigation aims to determine if the hypothesis extends to soft prompts that encode specific visual concepts, and whether these prompts converge to a solution that different models can interpret.

training model for fine - tuning. our methods mainly include three parts, respectively coarse tuning, fine tuning, and postprocessing. in the first part, coarse tuning aims to build a synthetic dataset similar to the competition dataset and train a weak semantics but strong generalization model on the synthetic dataset. the weak semantics is because the synthetic dataset contains dirty data and labels so the semantic learning is not accurate enough. strong generalization is due to the large scale of the synthetic dataset, so the generalization ability is relatively strong. in the second part, the fine - tuning stage loads the coarse - tuning part weight and continues to train the competition dataset. the third part, post - processing, through bounding box matching, replacing, and model ensemble, further improves the accuracy of model prediction. coarse tuning stage the first part is the coarse tuning stage. we construct the coarse - tuning dataset through coco images. there are several features of constructing synthetic datasets. first, the image distribution, question distribution, and bounding box distribution of the coarse tuning dataset should be as close as possible to the competition dataset, so that the model can avoid learning the wrong data distribution ; secondly, any sampling operation must be random sampling, which can ensure that the model will not learn any data bias. finally, do not sample any data in the test public set, which can avoid overfitting the model to the test public set. the coarse -

Recent advancements, such as long-context LMMs, now allow these models to ingest multiple images simultaneously (Liu et al., 2024a; Chen et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2024) . However, fitting more visual tokens within a context window does not inherently translate to improved performance in more complex, multi-image question-answering (MIQA) scenarios. In fact, we demonstrate in Sections 2.1 and 3 that long-context LMMs are unable to accurately retrieve or reason across thousands of images, thereby debilitating for real-world applications such as searching through photo albums or analyzing medical and satellite imagery. This motivates the development of rigorous benchmarks that evaluate these capabilities, and methods that can appropriately retrieve and reason, in large-scale settings. The Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) benchmark (Kamradt, 2023 ) is a popular method for evaluating long-context models. The task is simple: a specific set of words (a \"needle\") is inserted into a large set of text (a \"haystack\"). Models are then assessed on their ability to find the needle in the haystack. In natural language processing (NLP), this simple evaluation has revealed intriguing behaviors, such as the \"lost-in-the-middle\" phenomenon in which needles placed in the middle of the haystack are harder to find than those placed at the beginning or end (Liu et al., 202\n\ndatasets which typically focus on two-image inputs and lack diverse question types. This limits MIRAGE's ability to effectively handle tasks requiring reasoning across more than three images with varied queries. Future enhancements to MIQA datasets could address these challenges.

For instance, the simple act of a person scratching their arm gains added context when a mosquito is present on a nearby nightstand, as depicted in Fig. 1 . While humans easily recognize such contextual nuances, existing image-understanding models struggle to integrate visual cues with world knowledge stemming from cultural aspects, life-experiences, and physical or social knowledge [1] [2] [3] [4] . This gap has spurred the development of various benchmarks like VisIT-Bench [5] and Encyclopedic VQA [6] , which rely on pre-existing images to formulate challenging questions. While effective, this approach risks using images seen during pre-training of large vision-language models and restricts the scope of scenarios to those already captured, potentially limiting creativity and challenge variety. To address these shortcoming, we introduce Visual Riddles, a benchmark comprising 400 visual riddles, each featuring a question and a synthetic image generated specifically for the challenge. The process of creating a riddle involves designing a scenario with embedded clues that appear as natural elements, then translating this scenario into both an image and a question ( §3). For example, as shown in the top of Fig. 1 , a seemingly inconspicuous mosquito becomes a key clue to explain the person's discomfort.

Overall, model performance on this task slightly exceeds that on the open-ended task as assessed by human evaluators. Excluding instances where models selected the \"cannot determine\" option enhances these figures, elevating GPT-4 to 52% and Gemini-Pro-1.5 to 48%. This trend, detailed further in A.7, reveals that models often default to \"cannot determine\" in the absence of sufficient information. This tendency is mitigated by providing hints and attributions, making GPT-4's accuracy significantly increase to 69% and 82%, respectively. Post-submission results further highlight this trend, with GPT4o leading the models at 55% accuracy overall and reaching 83% with hints.

The results reveal a relationship between misleader type and prompting strategy, highlighting the importance of understanding the models' reasoning strategies that lead to errors.\nOur experiments demonstrate that providing richer guidance under the guided few-shot setup improved the model's performance in detecting reasoning misleaders, but was less effective in detecting design misleaders compared to the guided zero-shot approach.

They can be constructed by manipulating data (e.g., cherry-picking), visualization design (e.g., truncated axes), or accompanying content (e.g., biased caption). The digital era and social media have notably amplified their spread and reach. Remarkably, false information spreads faster and more broadly than factual information on social media, suggesting that misleading visualizations are also likely to spread widely, reaching considerable audiences [5, 20, 31, 37] . Like other forms of misinformation, misleading visualizations can have adverse personal and social consequences. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, exposure to misleading visualizations and misinformation reduced some people's willingness to vaccinate [24] and comply with other preventative measures such as wearing masks [29] . Enabling everyday consumers of online information to detect and avoid misleading visualizations is a non-trivial task. Examining the veracity of information and visualizations requires complex knowledge, including sufficient data visualization, media, and scientific literacy [17, 18, 23, 30, 38] as well as critical analysis skills [3] , which many everyday users of digital social platforms may lack. Hence, education is often regarded as the primary defense against misleading visualizations [1, 5, 9, 12, 34] . This\n\ns Table 1 offers additional details about the misleaders and their prevalence in the final test dataset. The discrepancy in the number of positive cases among different types of misleaders mirrors the distribution in the original dataset [21] , suggesting that certain issues may be more common in real-world scenarios. Detailed descriptions of each misleader are provided in the supplementary materials. Experiments Design We evaluated the models' ability to detect misleaders through four distinct experiments, i.e., naive zero-shot, naive few-shot, guided zero-shot, and guided few-shot, each varying in the level of guidance provided to the model. The naive zero-shot setup tested models' intrinsic ability to identify misleaders without any prior guidance or training, establishing a baseline for comparing the performance of other setups. The naive few-shot experiment leveraged the models' in-context learning capabilities, which have been shown to enhance performance across various tasks [4]\n\nt for a single misleader at a time. Since one visualization might include different misleaders simultaneously, we had to query the models multiple times to capture all of them, which is neither cost-efficient nor scalable for real-world deployment. At the same time, our results suggest that comprehensive prompts instructing the models to detect multiple misleaders simultaneously could lead to overly lengthy inputs and outputs, potentially overwhelming the models. Therefore, future studies should explore more effective strategies for detecting multiple misleaders. Additionally, developing methods to efficiently balance the depth of analysis with the manageability of input complexity will be crucial. This includes investigating hierarchical or modular prompting techniques and integrating feedback mechanisms to refine detection accuracy.

Visualization, as a unique method of representing data, plays a central role in this process, enabling a deep and intuitive understanding of complex datasets [18, 33] . Recent technological advancements, such as 3D printing and laser cutting [2, 5] , have enabled the creation of physical models with greater precision and speed, thus enhancing the accessibility of physicalization in visualization. Physicalization, which involves the presentation of data on tangible models, has been increasingly explored and applied in visualization fields. This medium has shown potential to complement or even surpass digital forms in certain scenarios. For instance, Swedish global health specialist Hans Rosling used physical commonplace items (LEGO blocks, toilet paper rolls, etc) to illustrate data regarding global development issues in a TED talk [6] , which allows the audience to capture and understand these professional data in a short period of time. Also, physicalization was used to show four-dimensional blood flow data [2] and the findings revealed that physicalization enhanced the audien\n\ndraw or write down their recollection of the visualization. • Offline/Online Options: Participants could complete the test offline or online.

There is now a growing interest in tackling tasks requiring more global reasoning, where local features do not provide significant information. Minsky and Papert put forward such tasks in 1969 with their connectivity study, exposing the limitations of the perceptron model. In this paper, we introduce an expanded set of global visual datasets involving graphs, strings, mazes, and image grids. We show that large vision models still struggle to learn these tasks efficiently. Similarly, state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs perform poorly on these datasets. We explain this learning inefficiency by means of the 'globality degree' measure. To mitigate this, we propose a method called chain-of-sketch (CoS). Similar to the chain-of-thought and scratchpad techniques used in language models, CoS breaks the original task into intermediate visual steps to help learn a complex task. In addition, we show that not all CoS strategies perform equally well. Our key insight is to impose a Markovian structure on the CoS frames. This leads to the introduction of 'inductive CoS' which achieves better out-of-distribution generalization and performs well even with smaller models compared to non-inductive variants. 1 * Equal contribution. 1 An earlier version appeared on arXiv under the title \"Visual Scratchpads: Enabling Global Reasoning in Vision\".

While this has led to impressive capabilities, measuring the extent to which these models perform reasoning is still under investigation. Evidence suggests that many of these models, acting as blurry, compressed versions of the Internet, excel at smooth interpolation within their encoded knowledge, but often struggle to grasp underlying logic and extrapolate robustly. Unfortunately, classical visual benchmarks are limited to tasks that can often be tackled with superficial cues and local features. Despite progress in visual and multi-modal reasoning benchmarks [Yue et al., 2023 , 2024 , Hao et al., 2025] , there is a need for datasets that rigorously test global reasoning and multi-step visual problem-solving. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by exploring when and how models are capable of learning tasks that require multi-step global processing of the input. To that end, it is crucial to define the characteristics of global visual tasks. In contrast to local tasks, where a small subset of pixels-typically organized into patches-is sufficient to achieve better-than-random accuracy, global tasks require a more holistic understanding of the entire visual scene. For example, in ImageNet classification [Deng et al., 2009] , a single patch containing cat whiskers significantly increases the likelihood that t\n\nen shown the absence or the use of different absolute or relative positional embeddings [Shaw et al., 2018 , Dai et al., 2019] result in significant variations in length generalization performance [Kazemnejad et al., 2023] .

This is despite the fact that vision provides an excellent ground for OOD and length generalization experiments since one can easily depict more challenging examples with the same image resolution which removes the element of using suitable positional embeddings from the picture.

The computational implications of these components are also discussed in Appendix B.2. For even k, the label is equal to the parity of the number of cars, which is the same as the parity of the number of planes. In text, histogram refers to reporting how many times each token is appearing regardless of its position (similar to the bag of words). We use min-max normalized accuracy in the plot, including the random baseline for normalization. For the rectangular maze task, we slightly reduced the size of the blue and red cells in our images so that they do not touch the walls of the maze, eliminating any potential ambiguities for the model. The models can potentially come up with symbolic representations for the cycles and rectangular maze tasks, whereas doing so for the strings and circular maze tasks is more challenging. For extra clarity, the visualization is enhanced in Figure Nevertheless, this behavior is also evident in the non-enhanced outputs, as shown in the third row of Figure22.

[ 2024 ] introduces the notion of sketchpad. for a question ( consisting of text and visual components ) they use a set of visual operations and tools including drawing lines, placing bounding boxes with object detection models, and using python to produce plots to generate a sketch that can potentially facilitate the reasoning process. the main difference with our works is that we focus on visual tasks that have a high globality degree and require multiple reasoning steps to solve, whereas hu et al.

The proposed datasets, including the cycles task and strings task, present a significant challenge to the transformers, as they require tracing paths and considering local features, which are not informative for the task.", "metrics": {"hwt": {"llama": {"perplexity": 11.311062736078481, "burstness": 2.744140625, "curvature": 0.09072265625000009}, "gpt2": {"perplexity": 22.84897480427519, "burstness": 3.033203125, "curvature": 0.09121093750000009}}, "only_llm": {"llama": {"perplexity": 3.2311934640416666, "burstness": 1.623046875, "curvature": 0.272705078125}, "gpt2": {"perplexity": 7.683402631361398, "burstness": 2.01171875, "curvature": 0.2982421875000001}}, "rag": {"llama": {"perplexity": 12.942893525362278, "burstness": 2.908203125, "curvature": 0.11650390625000018}, "gpt2": {"perplexity": 24.275148340672132, "burstness": 2.90625, "curvature": 0.1905273437499999}}}}

Narrative research has given considerable attention to defining and classifying character types. However, these character-type taxonomies do not generalize well because they are small, too simple, or specific to a domain. We require robust and reliable benchmarks to test whether narrative models truly understand the nuances of the character's development in the story. Our work addresses this by curating the CHATTER dataset that labels whether a character portrays some attribute for 88124 character-attribute pairs, encompassing 2998 characters, 12967 attributes and 660 movies. We validate a subset of CHATTER, called CHATTEREVAL, using human annotations to serve as a benchmark to evaluate the character attribution task in movie scripts. CHATTEREVAL also assesses narrative understanding and the long-context modeling capacity of language models.", "abstract_only_llm": "Narrativity is a fundamental aspect of human communication, encompassing the sequence of events that form a story.

We selected these models because they can handle long contexts (128K tokens). We experiment with four prompting strategies. 1) Priors -We prompt the model with the character name, the list of movies where the character has appeared, and the trope definition. We do not include any screenplay content and ask the model to find the attribution label based solely on its prior knowledge about the character. 2) Script -We include the full movie script in the prompt. 3) Segment (Zero-shot) -We include the segments of the movie script where the character speaks or is mention\n\nustice, satisfying audience's desire for retribution 36.

We evaluated the representations learned by the model to classify audio-visual correlation as well as to recommend sound effects for visual scenes. Our results show that the representations generated by the attention model improves the correlation accuracy compared to the baseline, by 18% and the recommendation accuracy by 10% for VGG-Sound, which is a public video dataset.

The learned representations are useful for some of the audiovisual (A-V) content creation tasks. Our motivation is to use these representations to recommend sound effects based on the visual scene, in order to assist sound designers in creating entertaining video content, such as short trailers or video games. Currently, sound effect generation (a technique called Foley) for video game or movie content generation is a time-consuming and iterative process, as shown in Figure 1 . Given a silent video sequence, in the first step the sound designer identifies the relevant sound categories by understanding the visual scene. For example, for the video frame shown in Figure 1 , a designer may identify water-related sounds and human voices as sounds that correspond to the visible objects. Additionally, ambient sounds, such as wind related sounds, may also be relevant, even though this background context may not be visible. Next, specific sound samples for the selected sound categories are retrieved from a sound database. This sound selection and retrieval process is iterative, since there may be numerous variations of sound samples within a category. The selected sound samples are then used to create the desired sound effects for the video.

While these approaches rely on data augmentation to learn self-supervised unimodal representations, we propose a cross-modal contrastive learning approach for learning both audio and visual representations, without relying on data augmentation. Our contrastive network architecture uses the same attention-based 2-stream audiovisual encoder shown in Figure 2b as its backbone, but uses a different projection module, training strategy, and loss function.

These models can create complex scenes with multiple interacting elements that generally align with user-provided textual prompts. However, integrating visual prompts, which are images that guide the generation process, is not a native capability of common model architectures, which lack an inherent mechanism for using them to generate semantically coherent compositions. As a result, personalization and customization methods have emerged to address this limitation [17, 32, 52] . Initial methods required persubject optimization, adding a significant computational overhead per subject. Recently, feed-forward methods were introduced to accelerate the process. One widely used method is image prompt adapters (IP-Adapters) [67] . These adapters encode the entire input image and incorporate it into the model through decoupled cross-attention layers, allowing it to process textual and visual cues jointly. While IP-Adapters offer additional control, they present two main drawbacks. First, they treat the input image as a single, unified prompt, limiting the model's ability to differentiate and control individual objects within the scene. Second, these adapters encounter an inherent identity-diversity tradeoff when balancing the identity preservation of the objects depicted in the visual prompts with divers\n\n id = n (1 -Sim(n, σ(n))), (3) where Sim is defined as in Equation 2 .

We backpropagate this loss through the model to update the appearance tokens of the fine-grained encoder A app (E F img (P n v )). Updating only the appearance tokens ensures that only the identity features are refined without affecting the overall scene layout.

attention layers [ 7 ]. specifically, a text embedding vector c is derived from a text prompt p t using a frozen clip [ 48 ] text encoder c = e text ( p t ). this text embedding interacts with the generated image deep spatial features ( x t ) as follows. the im - age features ( x t ) are projected to queries q = f q ( ( x t ) ), while the text embedding is projected to keys k = f k ( c ) and values v = f v ( c ), where f q, f k, and f v are learned linear layers. the output of the cross - attention layer is computed as mv, where m are the attention maps defined as m = softmax qk t / √ d. previous works have shown that each component of attention has its own role [ 2, 21, 40, 59 ]. the keys, which form the attention map, tend to control the layout, and the values determine the appearance. we use this observation to control the identity preservation - diversity tradeoff. prompting with images. while natural language allows us to control generation with simple words, it often fails to provide precise descriptions of objects. recent methods [ 18, 53, 67 ] extend text -

Recent open-source work like DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward is one key direction in reproducing o1. While the R1-style model has demonstrated success in language models, its application in multi-modal domains remains under-explored. This work introduces Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT), which further extends the application areas of RFT on visual tasks. Specifically, Visual-RFT first uses Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multiple responses containing reasoning tokens and final answers for each input, and then uses our proposed visual perception verifiable reward functions to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We design different verifiable reward functions for different perception tasks, such as the Intersection over Union (IoU) reward for object detection. Experimental results on finegrained image classification, few-shot object detection, reasoning grounding, as well as open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks show the competitive performance and advanced generalization ability of Visual-RFT compared with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT). For example, Visual-RFT improves accuracy by 24.3% over the baseline in oneshot fine-grained image classification with around 100 samples. In few-shot object detection, Visual-RFT also exceeds the baseline by 21.9 on COCO's two-shot setting and 15.4 on LVIS.

Although the implementation details of o1 are not publicly available, recent open-source studies like DeepSeek R1 [4] reveal one promising direction in reproducing o1 is Verifiable Rewards [4, 12, 37] : the reward score in reinforcement learning is directly determined by pre-defined rules, rather than predicted by the separate reward model [17, 26, 45] trained on preference data. A primary distinction between the RFT and Previous Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) lies in data efficiency. Previous SFT paradigm (see Fig. 2 (a) ) directly imitates the \"groundtruth\" answers provided in the high-quality, curated data, thus relying on a large amount of training data. By contrast, RFT evaluates the model's responses and adjusts based on whether they're correct, helping it learn through trial and error. Thus, RFT is particularly useful in domains where data is scarce [7, 24] . However, a previous common sense is that RFT is applied merely in tasks like scientific (e.g., mathematics) and code generation. That's because math and coding exhibit clear and objective final answers or test cases, making their rew\n\nl domain, we conduct few-shot experiments on fine-grained image classification. We selected four datasets: Flower102 [22] , Pets37 [27] , FGVC-Aircraft [21] , and Car196 [10] , which contain dozens to hundreds of similar categories, adding significant difficulty to the classification task. As shown in Tab. 2, with just one-shot of data, Visual-RFT already delivers a significant performance boost (+24.3%). In contrast, SFT shows a noticeable decline (-4.3%) with the same minimal amount of data. Under the 4-shot setting, the performance of SFT is still slightly lower than the baseline, while the reinforcement fine-tuned model with Visual-RFT achieves an average performance improvement of 25.9. Under the 8-shot and 16-shot settings, as the amount of data increases, SFT's performance slightly exceeds the baseline. However, SFT still lags significantly behind the performance of the Visual-RFT.

Training this model requires large-scale paired human data, consisting of multiple images per individual with consistent full-body identities, which is notoriously difficult to obtain. To address this, we propose a data curation pipeline leveraging vision-language models to evaluate fullbody appearance consistency, resulting in Visual Persona-500K-a dataset of 580k paired human images across 100k unique identities. For precise appearance transfer, we introduce a transformer encoder-decoder architecture adapted to a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, which augments the input image into distinct body regions, encodes these regions as local appearance features, and projects them into dense identity embeddings independently to condition the diffusion model for synthesizing customized images.

The success of these models enables users to customize pre-trained models with their own personal data [17, 56, 66, 90] . More recently, such methods have focused on human data [18-20, 48, 60, 61, 74, 81, 84, 88, 90, 94] , driven by various practical applications, including film production [35, 53] , book illustration [3, 80] , and virtual/augmented reality [9, 41, 47, 55] . These methods allow users to synthesize novel renditions of specific individuals. However, most human-customized models primarily focus on generating human face images [18-20, 48, 60, 84, 88, 90] , restricting their applicability to the face domain. This limitation motivates us to broaden the scope of previous studies to the full-body human domain, which we refer to as Full-Body Human Customization, a largely underexplored area. In this paper, we aim to develop a foundational model for full-body human customization, unlocking a wide range of in-the-wild applications. We argue that such a foundational model should satisfy two key criteria: text alignment and identity preservation. Text alignment refers to the ability to generate diverse images aligned with given text descriptions, adjusting to variations in facial expressions, poses, actions, and surroundings. Identity preservation ensures that the model produces a consistent full-body appearance that accurately\n\nent methods: IP-Adapter [90] , StoryMaker [94] , and Visual Persona. The same input images and prompts were used across all methods to ensure intra-rater reliability. Compared to StoryMaker [94] , IP-Adapter [90] and Visual Persona demonstrate superior alignment with facial expression prompts. This difference arises because Story-Maker [94] employs ArcFace loss [13] , which often leads to overfitting to the pose and expression of the input image, while IP-Adapter [90] does not account for facial expression in the text prompt during training. In contrast, Visual Persona captures facial expressions through detailed text descriptions generated by Phi-3 [1] (Sec. 4.1), without relying on facial loss, enabling it to generate diverse facial expressions while maintaining facial identity consistency. C.4. Human Evaluation Human Evaluation Metrics. For rigorous human evaluation, we followed the ImagenHub [43] evaluation protocol, which standardizes the assessment of conditional image generative\n\nd match the described context, including location, props, and overall atmosphere. 4. Composition: Assess how naturally the arrangement of the human subject in the generated image aligns with the description, considering variations in the subject's placement, position, and size. 5. Image Quality: Evaluate whether the overall image exhibits realistic fidelity, clarity, and visual appeal, avoiding an overly synthetic or artificial look.### Scoring RangeBased on these criteria, a specific integer score from 0 to 9 can be assigned to determine the level of semantic consistency: -Very Poor (0): No correlation. The image does not reflect any of the key points or details of the text.-Poor (1-2): Weak correlation. The image addresses the text in a very general sense but misses most details and nuances.-Fair (3-4): Moderate correlation. The image represents the text to an extent but lacks several important details or contains some inaccuracies.-Good (5-6): Strong correlation. The image accurately depicts most of the information from the text with only minor omissions or inaccuracies.-Very Good (7) (8) : Very strong correlation. The image captures nearly all relevant details from the text, with very few omissions or inaccuracies.-Excellent (9): Near-perfect correlation. The image captures the text's content with high precision and detail, leaving out no significant information. ### Input format Every time you will receive a text prompt and an image. ### Output Format Score: [Your Sc", "only_llm_prompt": "You are writing an academic abstract.\nKeyword: visual_understanding\nBrief summary (2 sentences): Introduction Recent advances in large-scale generative models [27, 63, 65, 68, 75] have made remarkable strides in creating photorealistic images.

ure a. 2, where visual persona achieves higher human preference scores in identity preservation ( human - i ) and text alignment ( human - t ), yet existing metrics ( i dino, i clip, t clip ) assign higher scores to storymaker [ 94 ] across all three metrics. this discrepancy arises because these metrics extract global vectors from the generated images and the given conditions ( input image or text prompt ) and calculate the distances between them, thereby ignoring local appearance details, intricate human poses, actions, and surrounding elements in the images. for human evaluation ( human -

Alternatively, sketching visual instructions convey more precise spatiotemporal informa- tion. Traditionally, communication between humans and robots relies on natural language, leveraging the advances in large language models (LLMs) to convert verbal or textual language instructions into executable actions for robots [7, 9, 33, 39] . While natural language is an intuitive and convenient medium for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), it presents certain challenges. Specifically, natural language has difficulty in describing spatial details such as the precise position, direction, or distance of objects [12, 23] . It is also prone to generating ambiguity and verbosity when expressing spatial requirements [6, 46] shown in Figure 2 . Moreover, in certain public environments, such as libraries and hospitals, verbal communication may be inappropriate. In contrast, visual modalities-such as goal images [14, 42, 45] , trajectories [21, 48, 51] , and subgoal images [32, 45] -offer a more direct and precise means of conveying spatio-temporal information. However, the practical application of such methods is not user-friendly shown in Figure 2 . The goal image requires the input of the end state of the robotic arm and the scene upon task completion, which contradicts the user's operational sequence. On the other hand, the trajectory represents the complete path of the end effector from the first to th\n\nδ trans (t) + (1 -α i ) δ rot (t), (4) where α i indicates the action type: α i = 1 for translation and α i = 0 for rotation. Translational Cost: δ trans (t) = ∥e t -e i ∥, where e t is the current end-effector pose and e i is the target pose, with ∥•∥ denoting the Euclidean norm. Rotational Cost: δ rot (t) = |θ t -θ i |, where θ t is the current rotation angle, θ i is computed as: θ i = arccos (v i ) ⊤ v i+1 ∥v i ∥∥v i+1 ∥ , (5) with c , where c is the rotation center. v i = p ′ i -c and v i+1 = p ′ i+1 - Experiment Our experiments aim to conduct in-depth research on the following questions: 1.

The model determines visual sensory precisions based on both current environmental beliefs and sensory input, influencing attentional allocation in both covert and overt modalities. To test the effectiveness of the model, we analyze its behavior in the Posner cueing task and a simple target focus task using two-dimensional(2D) visual data. Reaction times are measured to investigate the interplay between exogenous and endogenous attention, as well as valid and invalid cueing. The results show that exogenous and valid cues generally lead to faster reaction times compared to endogenous and invalid cues.

This ability helps humans avoid sensory overload, and as robots acquire more complex sensory channels it could help decrease the computational load required to perform in daily tasks, such as object tracking and visual search, as well as social interactions [1] - [3] . Attention is often separated into top-down, or goaldriven attention, and bottom-up or stimulus-driven attention, with some theories including hysteresis as a third component [4] . Top-down attention bilaterally activates dorsal posterior parietal and frontal regions of the brain, while bottom-up attention activates the right-lateralized ventral system, with the dorsal frontoparietal system combining the two into a \"salience map\" during visual search [5] , [6] . Furthermore, visual attention is separated into overt and covert attention [7] , [8] , with overt attention involving saccadic eye movements to the attentional target, and covert attention referring to attention shifts to the target while the eyes remain fixated elsewhere. Multiple approaches exist to model attention, more numerous being those that are based on Bayesian inference [9] - [16] .

In order to explore and analyze the impact of 3D visual illusion on depth estimation, we collect a large dataset containing almost 3k scenes and 200k images to train and evaluate SOTA monocular and binocular depth estimation methods. We also propose a 3D visual illusion depth estimation framework that uses common sense from the vision language model to adaptively fuse depth from binocular disparity and monocular depth. Experiments show that SOTA monocular, binocular, and multi-view depth estimation approaches are all fooled by various 3D visual illusions, while our method achieves SOTA performance.", "abstract_only_llm": "Depth estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision, aiming to recover the 3D geometry of a scene from a single image or an image sequence.

It is a long-standing and challenging vision problem, with extensive research in monocular depth estimation [46, 47, 3, 17] , stereo matching [27, 42, 5, 13] , and multi-view reconstruction [41, 39] .", "only_llm_body": "Introduction Depth estimation aims to recover the 3D geometry of a scene from a single image or an image sequence. It is a long-standing and challenging vision problem, with extensive research in monocular depth estimation [46, 47, 3, 17] , stereo matching [27, 42, 5, 13] , and multi-view reconstruction [41, 39] . These works have achieved impressive performance in typical, well-structured scenes, approaching human-level perception. However, beyond typical scenes, there exist many 3D visual illusion scenes that make a flat artwork or object look three-dimensional, as illustrated in Figure 1 . These 3D visual illusions mislead the depth perception and seriously affect the downstream applications, causing safety-critical risks in AR/VR and robotics. In this paper, we present a 3D-Visual-Illusion dataset to investigate the impact of 3D visual illusions on depth estimation. The dataset includes five types of illusions: inpainting illusion (e.g., inpainting on walls or floors), picture illusion (e.g., image printed/drawn on a paper), replay illusion (e.g., videos replayed on different screens), holography illusion, and mirror illusion (e.g., specular and transparent surfaces). It comprises nearly 3,000 scenes and 200,000 images, covering various environments from small objects to large scenes and from indoor to outdoor settings. We construct the dataset from both virtual and real-world data. Virtual data is generated using two separate pipelines: one based on web-sourced videos an\n\nn data, different illusion types are inherently conflicting: mirror illusions rely on spatial context (i.e., monocular priors) for accurate depth estimation, whereas inpainting, picture, replay, and holography illusions deliberately mislead models by distorting these priors. Thus, features learned from mirror illusions are compromised when the model is trained on other illusion types, leading to conflicting learning of monocular priors. Moreover, since we assume a flat plane to rectify disparity during the generation of virtual illusion data, the finetuned stereo models tend to produce overly flat disparities. This results in a slight improvement on transparent glass regions but severe degradation on other non-transparent and non-planar objects. In addition to illusion scenes, we also present the performance of our model in the Middlebury dataset. We compare our model with several SOTA stereo-based approaches using metric disparity space over the entire image, without restricting the m\n\nStereoAnything RAFT-Stereo Ours EPE ↓ 2.34 2.59 2.66 2.89 1.92 1.50 Bad-2 ↓ 12.04 11.79 10.18 11.93 12.60 11.79 Left Image GT DepthAnything Marigold DepthPro V2 Right Image Ours Dust3R VGGT Metric3D Left Image GT DepthAnything Marigold DepthPro V2 Right Image Ours Dust3R VGGT Metric3D Left Image GT DepthAnything Marigold DepthPro V2 Right Image Ours Dust3R VGGT Metric3D Table 6 : 6 Ablation study on the Booster dataset.

In the open-source research community, while significant progress has been made in language-only agentic abilities such as function calling and tool integration, the development of multi-modal agentic capabilities that involve truly thinking with images, and their corresponding benchmarks, are still less explored. This work highlights the effectiveness of Visual Agentic Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-ARFT) for enabling flexible and adaptive reasoning abilities for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). With Visual-ARFT, open-source LVLMs gain the ability to browse websites for real-time information updates and write code to manipulate and analyze input images through cropping, rotation, and other image processing techniques. We also present a Multi-modal Agentic Tool Bench (MAT) with two settings (MAT-Search and MAT-Coding) designed to evaluate LVLMs' agentic search and coding abilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that Visual-ARFT outperforms its baseline by +18.6% F1 / +13.0% EM on MAT-Coding and +10.3% F1 / +8.7% EM on MAT-Search, ultimately surpassing GPT-4o. Visual-ARFT also achieves +29.3 F1% / +25.9% EM gains on existing multi-hop QA benchmarks such as 2Wiki and HotpotQA, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Among them, OpenAI's o3 [29] exemplifies a major leap forward by demonstrating native support for tool-augmented reasoning across both textual and visual modalities. These capabilities mark a shift from static, single-turn inference to dynamic, multi-step decision-making, enabling models to browse the web [19] , execute code [20] , and manipulate images [29] to complete real-world tasks. While supervised fine-tuning has been the mainstream approach for enabling tool use in LLMs, it typically relies on curated demonstrations or handcrafted trajectories, which are costly to scale and difficult to generalize. A growing trend, however, is the use of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to train an agentic system. This shift is exemplified by OpenAI-o1 [11] , which highlights RFT as a key technique for rapidly adapting reasoning models to new domains using only a small number of examples. Although the exact details of o1 remain proprietary, DeepSeek-R1 [8] has shown that verifiable reward signals [15, 43] , derived from rule-based correctness checks rather than learned reward models [30, 23, 50] , can serve as an effective supervisory signal during RFT.

To further evaluate the generalization ability of Visual-ARFT, we conducted comprehensive experiments on several existing text-only multi-hop QA benchmarks, including 2WikiMultihopQA [9] , HotpotQA [46] , MuSiQue [44] , and Bamboogle [32] . Here we apply Visual-ARFT on Qwen2.5-VL-3B/-7B models using 20 manually annotated multimodal multi-hop VQA training examples (see section 4). Since our training is performed on VQA-style data involving both visual and textual modalities, there exists a clear modality and inputtype gap between our training set and these language-only QA benchmarks [9, 46, 44, 32] . As such, Ablation Studies and Visualization Results Reward Design. To assess our reward design (section 3.2.1), we replace the F1 score-based reward 33 with an EM-based alternative for both agentic search and coding. As shown in Tab. 3, EM-based training offers a slight improvement over the baseline, it consistently underperforms F1-based training. This unde\n\nerformance gains on these out-of-domain multi-hop QA benchmarks. The Qwen2.5-VL-3B model improves by +21.06% F1 and +17.25% EM over the baseline. The 7B model further surpasses all baselines, with average EM gains of 25.91% over direct inference. These improvements stem from Visual-ARFT 's ability to perform task decomposition and dynamic tool use, enabling step-by-step reasoning with flexible interaction with external information. Despite using only 20 training examples, Visual-ARFT achieves superior data efficiency and strong generalization across unseen domains. Moreover, Visual-ARFT is built on LVLM and outperforms several LMM-based methods, showcasing strong modality transfer and task generalization capabilities.

answer prompt suffix to the end of each test question, explicitly instructing the model to produce a concise answer. this strategy helps align the model's output with the expected format used in our automatic scoring pipeline. a commonly used suffix is :'answer the question directly.'this addition encourages models to avoid verbose explanation and return a short, focused response. while simple, this modification significantly improves evaluation compatibility and helps ensure a fairer comparison across models with varying instruction -

Local correlation analysis using linear data fitting can reveal linear and nonlinear relationships at different parts of the data.", "only_llm_body": "Introduction Correlation is important for multivariate data analysis. Local correlation analysis using linear data fitting can reveal linear and nonlinear relationships at different parts of the data. Well-established multivariate visualization methods such as scatterplots and parallel coordinates have been extended for viewing results of such analysis. Local correlation analysis can also be used as a powerful tool for visualizing multivariate data with spatial embedding, e.g., multivariate volumetric data [1] . In this paper, we propose a local correlation model for multivariate volume data that considers data values in their local spatial neighborhoods. Volumetric regions can be classified based on their multivariate data distributions-local linear relationships of different angles and various nonlinear structures can be identified using linear fitting. Another aspect of our method is the representation of local linear relationships as a density on a continuous domain. Although multivariate volumetric data are defined in a continuous spatial domain, they are typically treated as independent collections of discrete data points defined on grids. In contrast, we propose a continuousdomain extension of discrete indexed point representations in parallel coordinates [2] to capture the full information contents, consider their spatial configuration, and achieve a high-quality visualization. Figure 1 shows an example of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics for studying the thyroi\n\nayer of parallel coordinates: one for parallel coordinates lines for the original data values, and one for continuous indexed points. The dimensionality of the data domain, i.e., k = m, is used for the computation of kd-tree for the original data. For the indexed points, we use downsampled indexed points data from the volume and construct 2D trees as they live in the 2D image plane of parallel coordinates. The data value, 2D position, and subspace ID of the indexed point and its percentile and strength are stored in a kd-tree node. Thanks to kd-trees, brushing-and-linking between indexed points, parallel coordinates, and SPLOM is typically interactive or takes the most a few seconds for a large number of samples.

line duality that specifies the transformations between cartesian coordinates and parallel coordinates : a cartesian point maps to a polygonal line ( polyline ) in parallel coordinates and a cartesian line maps to a point in parallel coordinates ( figure 3 ). an indexed point is a point representation of a cartesian line ( 1 - flat ) or plane ( 2 - flat ) in parallel coordinates. the cartesian coordinates are associated with the space in which data points are represented. visually, can be identified with the canvas of a scatterplot in the 2d case. a data point p in cartesian coordinates is mapped to a line p in parallel coordinates ( figure 3 ( a ) ). in fact, that is how a traditional parallel coordinates visualization is constructed from input data. conversely, a line in cartesian coordinates is mapped to a point in parallel coordinates, i. e., 1 - flat indexed point, which is the intersection of a group of lines in parallel coordinates. see the orange line l and point l in figure 3 shows an example with two cartesian lines and figure 3 ( c ) more complex configurations with dense patterns. the idea indexed points can be extended recursively to represent a plane in 3d cartesian coordinates using a 2 - flat point in parallel coordinates ( figure 3 ( d ) ). for more details, we refer to the book by inselberg [ 5 ] or our previous work [ 2 ]. for the general case, higher - dimensional linear structures in ( p + 1 ) - dimensional cartesian coordinates can be represented with indexed points, i. e., p - flat indexed points [ 2, 5 ]. indexed points of p - flats can be used to visualize local multivariate correlations by local linear fitting in neighborhoods in cartesian coordinates [ 2 ]. in this paper, we consider the case of multivariate data with spatial embedding in 3d and focus on", "query": "What are the key contributions and significance of this work?"}, {"vector_id": 1671, "score": 0.5676343441009521, "text": "represented with indexed points, i. e., p -

flat indexed points go even further by enabling the comparative analysis of three variables, which was previously not possible. an extension to higher - dimensional indexed points is mathematically straightforward, but we leave the investigation of its use for visual data analysis to future research. for volumetric data, the calculation of indexed points involves three different domains ( figure 2 - top ) : the ndimensional spatial domain, the m - dimensional data domain of the multivariate data values living in the spatial domain, and the 2d image domain in which the indexed points are drawn. the conversions from the spatial domain to the data domain, and, eventually, to the image domain can be described by two maps. the map τ : r n → r m represents the mapping from the spatial domain to the data domain, i. e., the mathematical representation of the dataset ( along with interpolation ). since we focus on multivariate volumes, we have n = 3 for volumetric data. for full generalizability, we will keep an arbitrary n in the following mathematical description. the number of dimensions of the attached multivariate data is given by m. therefore, τ is a mathematical description of the dataset to be visualized. in the data domain, the representation of an indexed point is anchored at its data point and comprises the direction information from local linear fitting. we model such information for each data point by f : r n → r m ⊗ r ( p×m ), x → ( ξ, x ) = f ( x ), ( 1 ) with the data value ξ = τ ( x ) ( figure 2 -

line duality that specifies the transformations between cartesian coordinates and parallel coordinates : a cartesian point maps to a polygonal line ( polyline ) in parallel coordinates and a cartesian line maps to a point in parallel coordinates ( figure 3 ). an indexed point is a point representation of a cartesian line ( 1 - flat ) or plane ( 2 - flat ) in parallel coordinates. the cartesian coordinates are associated with the space in which data points are represented. visually, can be identified with the canvas of a scatterplot in the 2d case. a data point p in cartesian coordinates is mapped to a line p in parallel coordinates ( figure 3 ( a ) ). in fact, that is how a traditional parallel coordinates visualization is constructed from input data. conversely, a line in cartesian coordinates is mapped to a point in parallel coordinates, i. e., 1 - flat indexed point, which is the intersection of a group of lines in parallel coordinates. see the orange line l and point l in figure 3 shows an example with two cartesian lines and figure 3 ( c ) more complex configurations with dense patterns. the idea indexed points can be extended recursively to represent a plane in 3d cartesian coordinates using a 2 - flat point in parallel coordinates ( figure 3 ( d ) ). for more details, we refer to the book by inselberg [ 5 ] or our previous work [ 2 ]. for the general case, higher - dimensional linear structures in ( p + 1 ) - dimensional cartesian coordinates can be represented with indexed points, i. e., p - flat indexed points [ 2, 5 ]. indexed points of p - flats can be used to visualize local multivariate correlations by local linear fitting in neighborhoods in cartesian coordinates [ 2 ]. in this paper, we consider the case of multivariate data with spatial embedding in 3d and focus on"}, {"vector_id": 1671, "score": 0.5676343441009521, "text": "represented with indexed points, i. e., p -

Initially born in product lifecycle management, they have been used in different domains like the aviation sector, manufacturing, building and construction, and smart cities. DTs have recently increased in popularity in transforming healthcare through personalized virtual models, revolutionizing how patient care is delivered [1, 29, 32, 33] . Recent advances have pushed for the inclusion of visualization techniques [19] , visual analytics (VA) [38] , and human-computer interaction (HCI) [2] to the development of DT solutions. In healthcare, researchers have proposed solutions based on interactive dashboards, virtual reality interfaces, and immersive simulations that enhance the engagement of users (e.g., clinicians, caregivers, and patients) and facilitate decisionmaking [6, 11, 12, 35] . However, despite these technical achievements, users still have low involvement in the design and evaluation of such solutions [2] . Most solutions focus on optimizing computational and visual aspects without considering the multiactor (e.g., clinicians, caregivers, and patients) nature of healthcare services. As a result, many DT innovations risk poor integration into real-world workflows and limited adoption beyond proof-ofconcept phases. In parallel, service design (SD) [28] has emerged as a robust approach for designing complex services that are usercentered, participatory, and systemically grou\n\nces for broader healthcare experiences, enhancing the real-world applicability of DT solutions. To address the integration gap, we identify four main areas where SD principles can support the development of visualization-based digital twin systems in healthcare. This research agenda outlines how SD can enhance healthcare digital twins by addressing four goals: (1) improving utility, usability, and desirability through user research and ethical reflection; (2) balancing system efficiency with meaningful user experiences; (3) designing not only interfaces but holistic user journeys that foster trust and engagement; and (4) aligning digital twin development with healthcare policies and institutional workflows. Improving system utility, usability, and desirability Enhancing the effectiveness of visualization-based DT systems in healthcare requires focusing on their utility (meeting real-world needs), usability (ensuring systems are accessible and operable), and desirability (aligning with \n\nlarger service journey. Good user interfaces must be embedded in a coherent and seamless experience. Moreover, valuable to this aim are frameworks of UX principles for medical interfaces [26] . Service and Policy Innovation Consideration of policy, regulation, and standards is critical to ensure the responsible development and deployment of healthcare DT solutions. As emphasized by Tsekleves et al. [32] , the complexity of DT technologies demands proactive alignment with healthcare regulations, ethical standards, and institutional policies. Service design can play a key role here by offering participatory methods that connect system designers, clinicians, and policymakers early in the innovation process. Mager [16] highlights how SD brings decision-makers closer to real user needs. By leveraging tools such as service blueprints [4] and stakeholder mapping [24] , SD supports the design of digital twin systems that align with institutional workflows and policy objectives.

The K20 Center's educational game Operation: ELECT [10] was developed to aid in this new computational thinking education, while also connecting to social studies standards for electoral processes in the United States. In the game, students play as campaign managers who work to get their candidate elected. They are presented with simulated polling data, news events, and regional interests that they interpret to inform their decisions. To be successful, a player cannot simply address the specific circumstances of a given turn, but must also develop a long-term strategy. The game's primary Instructional Designer-and second author of this paper-is especially interested in analyzing and visualizing player strategy to evaluate the balance of game mechanics and to confirm the game's efficacy as an educational resource. In this paper, we explore the use of animated visualization as a means to reveal patterns in complex gameplay data.

It is also of interest to identify any correlation between individual or combinations of actions and when they are taken in a playthrough.

By analyzing existing literature and educational frameworks, we identify key factors that influence the effectiveness of visual aids in data literacy education, including the type of visual representation, the level of interactivity, and the context in which they are used.\nThe findings of this study have implications for educators, policymakers, and researchers seeking to develop more effective data literacy education programs.

Yet what counts as the 'right' design often depends on who is looking.", "only_llm_body": "INTRODUCTION Visualization can guide users to notice key patterns in data. Yet what counts as the 'right' design often depends on who is looking. People interpret data on a deeply personal level [64, 78] , thus visualization design effectiveness can depend on their analytic tasks [48] , their goals [67] , and most importantly, their visualization literacy [58, 62] . Existing research has demonstrated that we can improve visualization design by understanding where people look in a visualization [16] . Researchers have built saliency models to predict which parts of a visualization are most likely to attract a viewer's attention [15, 18, 53, 76, 85] . These models have proven valuable in supporting visualization and tool design, such as attention-aware UI [55] , chart compression [16] , and image quality evaluations [80] . However, existing models still largely assume universal viewing patterns among people and overlook differences driven by cognitive abilities such as visualization literacy [56, 79] . We posit that individuals with varying levels of visualization literacy interpret visualizations through distinct viewing patterns and can be effectively captured by models of their visual attention. Therefore, we argue that we can improve existing saliency models by accounting for the unique patterns in viewers' visual attention depending on their literacy levels. In this paper, we conduct user study (N = 235) using three established literacy tests: the mini Visualization Litera\n\nion was found on labels and legends. This aligns with the findings in Section 4.4 that SGL measures a distinct dimension of literacy compared to mini-VLAT and CALVI. Takeaway: Taken together, these findings support H2, suggesting that visual attention differs between novices and experts, driven by the distinct viewing patterns observed between correct and incorrect groups.

This paper explores the complexities of visual understanding, examining how the design of visualizations can shape users' perceptions of data and how these perceptions, in turn, impact decision-making and problem-solving outcomes.\nThrough a critical analysis of existing literature on data visualization, this study highlights the limitations of traditional approaches to design, which often prioritize aesthetics and cognitive efficiency over contextual factors and user needs. By examining the interplay between design elements, user characteristics, and task requirements, we shed light on the nuances of visual understanding and its dependence on subjective interpretations of data. The findings of this research have implications for the development of more effective and inclusive data visualization practices, which acknowledge the diversity of user experiences and perspectives.

[ 70 ] explored how novices attempt to interpret visualizations by letting them ask questions rather than responding to predefined ones. however, these domain - specific and exploratory methodologies limited the generalizability of research findings and comparability across different studies. to address this gap, lee et al. [ 46 ] proposed vlat, a standardized test assessing basic chart comprehension across diverse visualization types and tasks. garcia et al. [ 34 ] created a standardized self - assessment inventory of visualization literacy based on chart familiarity. in addition to evaluating chart comprehension and familiarity, researchers also recognized that literacy could be assessed through higher levels of thinking, such as critical reflection of visualization takeaways and evaluations of argument quality from visualizations [ 13 ]. for example, to evaluate the critical thinking process of visualization literacy, ge et al. [ 35 ] created calvi by adding trick questions where misinformation is deliberately included. quadri et al. [ 67 ] assessed the viewer's high - level chart comprehension by qualitatively comparing the takeaways with theme analysis. adar and lee [ 1 ] introduced a learning objectives framework to evaluate how viewers comprehend communicative visualizations matching the designer's goal. these assessments were frequently adopted in other research to assess general visualization literacy [ 29, 47 ], understand barriers better [ 21, 58 ], or benchmark large language models'visualization literacy [ 4, 37, 61 ]. researchers also considered enhancing the reliability and efficiency of these standardized tests by slightly tuning their structures. for example, mini - vlat, a subset of vlat [ 46 ], was developed with comparable diagnostic capability. cui et al. [ 26 ] also devised a compressed version of calvi, which reduced the average test questionnaires by half [ 26 ]. despite these efforts, assessing literacy remains time - intensive, particularly across multiple cognitive levels in bloom's taxonomy [ 31 ], from basic comprehension to critical thinking. this further motivated us to estimate literacy levels efficiently. although standardized tests provide individual score - based assessments, researchers typically group people to understand their common aspects better. for example, in the field of education, persky et al. [ 65 ] proposed a framework comprising five stages of expertise, ranging from beginner to expert, drawing inspiration from the dreyfus model [ 30 ], which similarly categorizes adults'skill acquisition into five distinct phases. reding et al.

We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple Polygon Problem. Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one. The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation. Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving. Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a far wider class of challenging geometric tasks. introduction Diffusion models have emerged as a transformative force in generative AI. Initially developed for image synthesis, they have quickly proven to be among the most powerful and versatile generative models across a wide range of media, including audio, video, and 3D content. Their ability to progressively denoise random signals into coherent and high-fidelity samples has enabled breakthrough applications, from photorealistic image generation to controllable editing and cross-modal translation. Beyond their remarkable empirical success, diffusion models are increasingly recognized as a general framework for modeling complex, multimodal distributions. In this work, we take a different perspective on diffusion models: rather than focusing on their creative generative capacity, we demonstrate their potential as solvers of hard geometric problems. We show that the sampling process of diffusion can be harnessed to directly reason about and discover geometric structures, guided only by pixel-level formulations of the problem.

Our method uncovers diverse approximate solutions, corresponding to different random seeds. Diffusion models have been used in various contexts to tackle optimization and reasoning problems, including combinatorial tasks such as the traveling salesman problem [26, 36, 40] . These approaches typically formulate the problem in symbolic or graphbased representations, leveraging the probabilistic nature of diffusion to search solution spaces. In contrast, our method operates purely in the visual domain. By representing geometric problems as images and reasoning directly in pixel space, we exploit the intrinsic strength of diffusion models in handling multimodal distributions and ambiguous solutions. This visual formulation makes our approach fundamentally distinct from prior problem-solving applications of diffusion. To ground our approach, we begin with the Inscribed Square Problem, a long-standing problem that asks whether every simple closed curve in the plane admits an inscribed square. The problem is still unsolved in the general case.

Given a set of vertices in the plane, the problem asks to find a simple polygon (a polygon that does not intersect itself and has no holes) that passes through all the vertices and has the largest possible area. MAXAP is known to be NP-complete [14, 15] and difficult to solve both in theory and in practice [16] , with no known algorithm that provides better than 1 2 -approximation factor in polynomial time. Furthermore, deciding whether there exists a simple polygon that contains strictly more than 2/3 of the area of the convex hull is also NP-complete [14] .

Our evaluation spans route planning, cellular automata, and abstract reasoning tasks, including the Arc-Agi benchmark and ConceptArc, a variant designed to measure visual concept understanding and generalization.\nResults show that our framework, referred to as the Visual Development Model (VDM), consistently outperforms LLMs in low-sample regimes, achieving a significant reduction in data requirements. The VDM also demonstrates stronger inductive biases, allowing it to generalize more quickly from limited training to larger, more complex tasks. Furthermore, the VDM exhibits complementary strengths to LLMs, as evident from the overlap between tasks solved by both models. Our qualitative results highlight the importance of strong visual priors, which are captured through representations that capture spatial structure and compositionality.", "only_llm_summary": "INTRODUCTION 0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 scale and pretraining can create systems that generalize across diverse problems.

Achieving a similar level of versatility in vision, however, remains largely unexplored and a major challenge. Despite recent breakthroughs in image and video generation (Labs, 2025; Polyak et al., 2024; Qin et al., 2024) , vision models are not yet on par with LLMs when it comes to compositional skills, sample efficiency, and versatility in problem solving. Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) represent an exciting direction for narrowing this gap. Pretraining on rich spatiotemporal data endows them with strong inductive biases for spatial structure and temporal dynamics (Blattmann et al., 2023; Google DeepMind, 2025; Wu et al., 2025) , which we hypothesize can be harnessed for structured visual understanding. We move beyond treating videos as mere generative artifacts and instead regard them as a natural representation for problem solving, where tasks are expressed as transformations unfolding over time. Building on this perspective, we introduce a simple and general framework for adapting VDMs to a broad class of visual tasks and evaluate them head-to-head with equally adapted LLMs (see Figure 1 ). This setup allows us to test whether large-scale video pretraining offers a complementary foundation for structured visual problem-solving, contrasting the strengths of visually grounded models with those of symbolically trained language models. Each task is represented consis\n\nular automata (CA). Our study spans one-dimensional Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA) Wolfram (1984) , a foundational class of binary-state systems, as well as two-dimensional Life-like Cellular Automata, including Conway's Game of Life Gardner (1970) , defined by various birth and survival (B/S) rules. Additionally, we consider Langton's ant Langton (1986), a deterministic agent-based system, where the task is to predict the complete grid state after n steps of evolution. For the 1D ECA experiments, we evaluate four representative rules from each of Wolfram's four complexity classes. We measure task completion as achieving an accuracy above a fixed threshold δ = 0.9. Figure 7 reports the number of training examples required to reach this performance for each rule. Across these rules, both models show broadly similar behavior, with the VDM being better in some cases and worse in others, though overall it remains competitive with the LLM. In two-dimensional settings, clearer difference\n\n; explosive expansion Life B3/S2 Sparse survival; promotes small, mobile clusters C ADDITIONAL QUALITATIVE RESULTS Table 9 : 9 Concept-wise overall accuracy across models.

It features two subtasks-visual question answering and multimodal explanation generation-based on the Kvasir-VQA-x1 dataset [2] . Building on this challenge, we address a key limitation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs): while VLMs recognize visual features well, they often lack medical terminology and reasoning for trustworthy clinical applications. Standard VQA training without explicit visual grounding or detailed explanations is insufficient for medical AI. We propose a multi-task learning framework enriching training with textual explanations and visual grounding through two curated datasets: (1) textual explanations providing medical reasoning for complexity-1 questions, and (2) visually grounded data linking answers to segmentation masks. Training Florence-2 [3] with this framework enables simultaneous learning of visual grounding, medical reasoning, and question answering, improving VQA performance while producing models grounded in visual evidence and medical knowledge. The principles guiding our framework draw from prior work that has consistently shown multi-task learning to be effective for vision-language models. [4] trained on 12 tasks, reducing parameters from 3B to 270M while improving performance by 2.05 points. Molmo [5] showed that curating detailed captioning, QA pairs, and 2D pointing enables smaller models to outperform larger closed-source mod\n\n tokens: <MedVQA> for VQA, <MedVQA_EXPLAIN> for explanations, and <REFERRING_EXPRESSION_SEGMENTATION> for region grounding (masks were converted to Florence-2 location tokens). Subtask 1 generated outputs using <MedVQA> with the question as input. Subtask 2 followed a twostep approach: first predicting the answer with <MedVQA>, then localizing the region using <REFERRING_EXPRESSION_SEGMENTATION> with the predicted answer. Explanations were generated using <MedVQA_EXPLAIN> with the question and the prompt \"Explain in detail\". A confidence score for each generated explanation was derived from decoding stability, computed as the average top-𝑘 (𝑘 = 5) probability mass over top tokens. We found that conflicting explanations scored lower, while correct ones scored higher, though further validation is needed. The polyp measures greater than 20 millimeters in size.

However, the model's textual explanations for structured tasks, such as presence detection and counting, exhibit mixed success, with significant weaknesses in completeness and faithfulness. The model excels with binary and quantitative attributes but struggles with descriptive ones, particularly color identification.\nThese findings highlight key challenges in training VLMs for gastrointestinal endoscopy, including synthetic data generation and class imbalance.

Abstract Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance on tasks such as visual grounding and visual question answering. However, the reasoning processes of these models remain largely opaque; they typically output only final predictions without revealing the intermediate steps or fine-grained evidence (e.g., pixels, locations) that lead to the result. This contrasts with human intelligence, which naturally operates through a chain of visual reasoning. To address this limita-tion, we introduce the Visual Reasoning Tracer (VRT) task, which requires models to not only localize the target object but also explicitly predict the intermediate objects that form the reasoning path. To advance research in this area, we contribute: (1) VRT-Bench, a human-annotated benchmark for evaluating visual reasoning; (2) a new metric for assessing the quality of reasoning traces; and (3) VRT-80k, a large-scale dataset for reasoning model training. Our experiments reveal that while existing models often produce the correct final output, they struggle to ground their intermediate reasoning. In contrast, models trained on VRT-80k\n\n this capability and achieve strong performance. By integrating visual evidence directly into language reasoning, this work provides a foundational framework for developing and evaluating MLLMs that are more interpretable and reliable, moving beyond merely producing correct answers to enabling verifiably grounded decision-making. Future directions include leveraging these grounded traces to enable model self-correction and extending the paradigm to dynamic video understanding. Visual Reasoning Tracer: Object-Level Grounded Reasoning Benchmark Supplementary Material Overview. This supplementary material provides additional details on the Visual Reasoning Tracer (VRT) beyond those in the main paper. We first elaborate on the construction of VRT-80k (Section A), including the multi-stage data pipeline that combines object-level segmentation and captioning (Section A.1), as well as the human labeling protocol and annotation tool (Section A. 2 in the main paper, the foundation of our VRT-80\n\nur implementation is built directly on the official Sa2VA model and training codebase [58], which couples SAM2 with an MLLM for dense grounded understanding. We keep the original Sa2VA architecture unchanged, includ- ing the SAM2-based visual encoder, the [SEG] token in- terface, and the mask decoder, and only adapt the lan- guage head to emit our VRT-style outputs (step-by-step traces and final answers) while preserving Sa2VA's input / output formats for segmentation. All data loading, opti- mization, and mask losses reuse the official training scripts and configurations. The Sa2VA repo exposes the base MLLM as a pluggable component, with multiple variants (e.g., InternVL2.5-/InternVL3-based 1B-26B models) pro- vided in the model zoo. Switching the backbone is done by changing a single configuration entry without modi- fying any other part of the system. In our experiments, all R-Sa2VA variants (e.g., R-Sa2VA-InternVL2.5-4B, R- Sa2VA-Qwen3-VL-4B) share identical training pipelines and hyperparameters and differ only in this choice of base MLLM, ensuring that comparisons across backbones are fair and attributable to the underlying VLMs. 2 ), weight decay, gradient clipping, and warmup settings as in SFT. During RL, each input is decoded with stochastic group generation: we sample four trajectories per input with a maximum of 1024 new tokens, temperature 1.2, top-p = 0.9, and topk = 0.

sa2va fails to segment the most important child wearing shoes, instead mistaking the black laces ( < obj6 > ) of the wooden planks for sandals. similarly, as shown in figure a16 and figure a17, the image presents an airport waiting area. the question requires identifying two objects that present conflicting information regarding the geographical location. the ground truth highlights the contradiction between the digital screen ( < obj1 > ) where'kota kinabalu'is listed as a destination for multiple flights and a wall poster explicitly stating'we are right in the heart of kota kinabalu city'which implies that the viewer's current location is kota kinabalu. however, r - sa2va fails to locate the critical text - based poster in the background and misses the definitive semantic conflict about the scene's location provided by the poster. it is observed that when the scene contains a dense collection of objects or text -

truth signboard, revealing a mismatch between its textual inference and spatial grounding. e. discussion of vrt - bench our vrt - bench is mainly focusing on the localizing the target object during the reasoning process. here we discuss and compare with other related works. mmr [ 14 ] focuses on multi - target and multi - granularity reasoning segmentation : a single instruction may refer to multiple objects and parts, and the dataset provides 194k complex, often implicit queries over object - and part - level masks. in contrast, vrt is not primarily about multi - target or part reasoning, but about making the entire reasoning path observable and evaluable. each vrt sample contains a question, a step - by - step textual explanation and, crucially, a segmentation mask for every mentioned object along the reasoning path, plus the final answer mask. vrt - bench further groups samples into comparison, function, location, and visual - detail categories and introduces logic quality ( lq ) and visual quality ( vq ) to measure how well models recover the sequence of grounded objects, rather than only the final target. mira [ 67 ] proposes a benchmark for visual chain - ofthought where intermediate visualizations ( sketches, structural diagrams, path drawings ) are necessary for solving complex reasoning problems, and evaluates models under text - only, text - plus - image, and full visual - cot settings. vrt shares the spirit of \" visualized reasoning \", but the representation and domain are quite different. mira asks models to generate imagined visual images that guide reasoning ; vrt instead uses pixel - accurate segmentation masks on real images as the visual traces, aligning each textual step with a set of object masks. in short, mira studies how imagined sketches help reasoning ; vrt studies how object - level segmentation traces can be used to evaluate and train grounded reasoning. seg - zero [ 27 ] is a method that decouples reasoning and segmentation : a reasoning model generates explicit chainof - thought and positional prompts, and a segmentation model uses these prompts to produce masks. the system is trained purely with grpo - style reinforcement learning, using format and accuracy rewards, and achieves strong zero - shot performance on reasonseg [ 21\n\nConstraints: Use only the context.
